       "'The Special Investigations Unit is a civilian law enforcement agency that investigates incidents involving an official where there has been death, serious injury, the discharge of a firearm at a person or an allegation of sexual assault. Under theSpecial Investigations Unit Act, 2019(SIUAct), officials are defined as police officers, special constables of the Niagara Parks Commission and peace officers under the Legislative Assembly Act. TheSIU’s jurisdiction covers more than 50 municipal, regional and provincial police services across Ontario.Under theSIUAct, the Director of theSIUmust determine based on the evidence gathered in an investigation whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence was committed.  If such grounds exist, the Director has the authority to lay a criminal charge against the official. Alternatively, in cases where no reasonable grounds exist, the Director cannot lay charges.  Where no charges are laid, a report of the investigation is prepared and released publicly, except in the case of reports dealing with allegations of sexual assault, in which case theSIUDirector may consult with the affected person and exercise a discretion to not publicly release the report having regard to the affected person’s privacy interests.\\nSpecial Investigations Unit Act, 2019Pursuant to section 34, certain information may not be included in this report.

TheSIUis also entitled to a copy of their notes.]\\nThe SceneThe events in question transpired over a stretch of highway beginning on Highway 401 between Putnam Road and Culloden Line, and travelling east to Highway 401 and the Plank Line exit.ASIUforensic investigator attended the scene on March 30, 2023, at 9:30 p.m., examining and photographing it.  TheOPPcruiser driven by theSOrevealed no collision damage consistent with contact with another vehicle.TheSIUforensic investigator noted that the Highway 401 eastbound off-ramp at Highway 19 (Exit 218) was a paved single-laned roadway with fog lines visible on both sides. The posted warning speed for the ramp was 50 km/h. The first curve proceeded right, which was followed by a curve to the left towards a traffic circle at Highway 19. Prior to the first curve, tire marks were noted that extended straight and then onto the left shoulder consisting of gravel. These tire marks continued past the shoulder into a field area where several gouges were found. These gouges continued to an ascending embankment that led to a flat area at the top. Halfway up the embankment, the gouging became wider and vehicle debris was scattered. On the top of the embankment was increased debris consisting of broken auto parts and interior personal effects. At the end of the gouged area and debris field was a Mercedes Benz on its roof with extensive damage.Video/Audio/Photographic Evidence[2]In-car Camera System (ICCS) FootageA review of the footage showed nothing that would further the investigation, as theOPPcruisers did not capture the Mercedes Benz on Highway 401, nor were they parked in a position to capture the extrication of the Complainant.Ministry of Transportation (MTO) Camera FootageOn April 1, 2023, at 11:33 a.m., aSIUinvestigator received a digital media stick from theMTOthat contained downloaded video from a Highway 401 eastbound camera for March 30, 2023, from 4:40 p.m. to 5:10 p.m.At 5:00 p.m., the imagery indicated that the weather was clear and dry; eastbound traffic was moderate on Highway 401.  The Mercedes Benz could be seen in the centre lane of traffic, after which it moved across the right lane and onto the exit ramp near Exit 218. The Mercedes Benz was travelling at a higher rate of speed that the other vehicle traffic, even as it travelled onto the off-ramp.  No other vehicles were in the vicinity or behind the Mercedes Benz at the time.Communications Recordings and Computer-assisted Dispatch (CAD) ReportStarting at about 5:02:52 p.m., theSOcontactedOPPdispatch and advised that he had had a vehicle fail to stop for him on Highway 401 eastbound approaching Culloden Line. TheSOreported that he had pulled over and stopped on the right shoulder of Highway 401, and he provided his vehicle mileage.  TheSOdescribed the involved vehicle as a silver Mercedes Benz and provided a partial licence plate.  The Mercedes Benz was travelling far too fast, and he felt it was too dangerous to follow.Starting at about 5:04:10 p.m., thePCCsergeant confirmed with theSOthat he was still stopped on the shoulder of Highway 401 and that any emergency equipment was deactivated.Starting at about 5:04:32 p.m., theSOtold thePCCsergeant that the reason for the attempt to stop the Mercedes Benz was aHighway Traffic Actoffence and that the Complainant had been travelling more than 180 km/h.Starting at about 5:04:32 p.m.,WO#3 advisedOPPdispatch that the Complainant might have been involved in a collision and rolled over at the Exit 218 off-ramp.Starting at about 5:11:24 p.m., thePCCsergeant advised theSOthat he was clear to resume patrols, and to attend the accident scene at Exit 218 to confirm if the vehicle involved in the collision was the same as the ‘fail to stop’ vehicle.Starting at about 5:14:36 p.m., theSOarrived at the accident scene and confirmed the vehicle involved in the collision was the same vehicle that had failed to stop.Materials Obtained from Police ServiceUpon request, theSIUreceived the following materials from theOPPbetween March 31, 2023, and April 14, 2023:CADReport;Communications recordings;ICCSfootage from involvedOPPvehicles;General Occurrence Report;General Report - Traffic Enforcement;Involved Officer Report - Traffic Enforcement;Involved Officer Report;Involved Persons Report - Traffic Enforcement;Will-state-WO#1;Notes ofWO#1;Notes ofWO#2;Notes of theSO;Notes ofWO#3;Notes ofWO#4;Civilian witness statements; andCivilian Witnesses List.Materials Obtained from Other SourcesTheSIUobtained the following records from other sources:MTOvideo footage from Highway 401, received April 1, 2023.\\nThe material events in question are clear on the evidence collected by theSIUand may briefly be summarized.In the afternoon of March 30, 2023, the Complainant was operating a Mercedes-Benz vehicle eastbound on Highway 401.  He was doing so recklessly and at speed, weaving in and out of traffic, passing motorists on the shoulders of the highway, and travelling upwards of 160 km/h on the estimate of some witnesses.TheSOwas also travelling eastbound on Highway 401 at the time.  While operating an unmarked Charger at about 120 km/h, the officer was passed in the centre lane by the Complainant’s Mercedes-Benz.  Deciding he would stop the vehicle for speeding, theSOactivated his vehicle’s emergency lights and accelerated to about 180 km/h attempting to catch up to the Mercedes-Benz.  As the Complainant continued to increase the distance between their vehicles, the officer pulled over onto the south shoulder of the highway and came to a stop east of Culloden Line.The Complainant continued apace.  As he approached Plank Line, he veered onto the off-ramp and lost control of the vehicle.  The Mercedes-Benz left the roadway, entered onto a grassy median and flipped several times before coming to a rest on its roof.First responders arrived on scene and extricated the Complainant from the wreckage.  He was taken to hospital with a fractured back and, possibly, other injuries.\\nSection 320.13 (1)Criminal Code– Dangerous Operation Causing Bodily Harm320.13(2) Everyone commits an offence who operates a conveyance in a manner that, having regard to all of the circumstances, is dangerous to the public and, as a result, causes bodily harm to another person.\\nThe Complainant was seriously injured in a single motor vehicle collision in Ingersoll on March 30, 2023.  As the vehicle he was driving had briefly been engaged by anOPPcruiser moments earlier, theSIUwas notified of the incident and initiated an investigation.  TheSOwas identified as the subject official.  The investigation is now concluded.  On my assessment of the evidence, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence in connection with the collision.The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.There is no evidence of any want of care on the part of theSO.  Having observed the Mercedes-Benz pass him at dangerously high speeds, the officer was within his rights in trying to stop the vehicle to issue an offence notice.  He too accelerated to about 180 km/h to try and narrow the gap with the Mercedes-Benz but only for a short period.  Realizing that the Mercedes-Benz was still pulling away, theSO, wisely, decided to disengage in the interests of public safety, slowing and bringing his cruiser to a stop by the side of the highway.  The officer was three kilometres away from the eventual site of the collision, which he came upon minutes later after receiving permission from theOPPcommunications centre to continue eastward.On the aforementioned-record, I am satisfied that theSOcomported himself with due care and regard for public safety, including the Complainant’s safety, throughout his brief engagement with the Complainant.  As such, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.  The file is closed.Date:\\tJuly 11, 2023Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit'"

       "'The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.There is no evidence of any want of care on the part of theSO.  Having observed the Mercedes-Benz pass him at dangerously high speeds, the officer was within his rights in trying to stop the vehicle to issue an offence notice.  He too accelerated to about 180 km/h to try and narrow the gap with the Mercedes-Benz but only for a short period.  Realizing that the Mercedes-Benz was still pulling away, theSO, wisely, decided to disengage in the interests of public safety, slowing and bringing his cruiser to a stop by the side of the highway.  The officer was three kilometres away from the eventual site of the collision, which he came upon minutes later after receiving permission from theOPPcommunications centre to continue eastward.On the aforementioned-record, I am satisfied that theSOcomported himself with due care and regard for public safety, including the Complainant’s safety, throughout his brief engagement with the Complainant.  As such, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.  The file is closed.Date:\\tJuly 11, 2023Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit'"
