2020,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,n r\n The following scenario emerges on the evidence collected by the SIU which included interviews with the Complainant and the SO as well as a number of other officers and civilian witnesses who observed parts of the events in question The investigation also benefitted significantly by video recordings from a police helicopter and a commercial premises that captured the incident In the evening of June 30 2020 a team of PRP tactical officers led by the SO was asked by PRP robbery investigators to assist in the arrest of persons suspected of committing a series of violent carjackings There had been a spike of these crimes in recent weeks in Peel Region and the Greater Toronto Area often times targeting Range Rovers Typically the suspects would stage a minor collision with the vehicle whereupon they would accost the driver after he or she exited the vehicle brandishing a gun or knife beat them if there was any resistance and drive off with the vehicle By June 30 2020 a number of vehicles used by the perpetrators of these crimes including a black Ford Mustang as well as several suspects had been identified by PRP robbery investigators The Complainant was among the suspects Earlier in the day PRP robbery investigators had received word from York Regional Police officers with whom they were collaborating on the carjacking investigation of one such incident in Markham Two men had approached a black Range Rover pistol whipped the owner in the head and drove off in his vehicle The Ford Mustang was involved in the robbery Several hours later PRP learned from the Halton Regional Police Service that the same Ford Mustang had followed a woman in her white Range Rover to her residence in Oakville As the driver pulled into her garage a male exited the Mustang ran up to the Range Rover and attempted to open the door The driver reversed out of the garage and the male fled the scene in the Mustang The male was the Complainant Finally about an hour later PRP investigators were informed that the Mustang had been seen striking the rear of a red Range Rover The female driver asked the driver of the Mustang – the Complainant – to follow her home to discuss the damage He did so However arriving at the woman’s address to find her husband at the bottom of the driveway inspecting the damage to the car the Complainant fled the area By the time of the last attempted carjacking PRP robbery investigators together with the SO and his team of officers were in their vehicles monitoring the movements of the Ford Mustang which had been seen to enter the City of Brampton At one point the Complainant stopped to let out a passenger in the rear seat before he made his way onto Torbram Road and travelled north As he approached Williams Parkway the Complainant turned into the Petro Canada gas station at the southeast corner of the intersection and stopped his vehicle at the northern most gas pump just west of the cashier’s kiosk The SO was the passenger in a Ford Expedition SUV being driven by WO 7 The officer conferred with the lead PRP detective in charge of their robbery investigation and decided they would attempt to stop the vehicle and arrest its occupants at this time He called the takedown signal The time was about 7:45 p.m The Ford Expedition entered the gas station lot from Torbram Road travelled around the east side of the cashier’s kiosk and drove up to the front passenger side of the Mustang bumping it as it came to a stop The SO exited through the Expedition’s passenger door gun in hand and pointed at the Mustang just as a Ford F350 pickup truck with WO 1 and WO 8 aboard pulled up and stopped front first at a 90-degree angle with the Mustang in front of the driver’s front corner of the vehicle At the sight of the SO and the vehicles surrounding his Mustang the Complainant accelerated in reverse trying to evade the blockade The Mustang did not get very far though as it struck the rear of a civilian SUV which had stopped for gas at the southern pump At about the same time the SO was making his way across the front of the Mustang handgun still pointed at the Complainant and yelling out at the driver to stop the vehicle The officer had noticed another civilian vehicle on the opposite side of the gas pump and was headed in that direction concerned that the Complainant might attempt to steal it to make good his escape After striking the vehicle behind him the Complainant accelerated and travelled forward in a northwest direction toward the SO As the officer moved to his right to avoid the vehicle he discharged his firearm three times in quick succession at the direction of the Complainant The final shot occurred around the time that the Complainant’s vehicle made contact with the SO and sent him to the ground The Ford F350 moved up a short distance and collided with the Mustang’s front end With the Mustang now at a standstill WO 1 exiting the passenger door of the F350 with a C8 rifle in hand and WO 6 the latter a dog handler who was part of the operation and had driven into the gas station lot bringing his vehicle to a stop south of the cashier kiosk approached the driver’s door and ordered the Complainant out of the vehicle When the Complainant failed to do so and instead continued to rev his engine WO 6 lifted his police dog and placed him inside the vehicle through the shattered driver’s door window The dog bit into the Complainant’s left upper arm  shoulder area and held on Shortly thereafter WO 6 discharged his CEW at the Complainant as did WO 1 This was followed by two punches to the Complainant head by WO 6 after which the officers extricated the Complainant from the Mustang and placed him on the ground The dog still with a hold of the Complainant as he exited the Mustang was released by WO 6 The Complainant was subsequently handcuffed As the Complainant’s was being arrested so too was his front seat passenger CW 1 CW 1 was removed from the Mustang by WO 7 and WO 8 Once CW 1 was on the ground and handcuffed WO 8 noticed a gun next to the front passenger seat of the Mustang Upon examination it was learned that the gun was an air pistol The three shots fired by the SO struck the Mustang One of them struck the driver’s side hood of the vehicle another struck the driver’s side lower corner of the windshield and the final shot impacted the driver’s door slightly below its top edge Only one of the bullets fired by the SO struck the Complainant The projectile entered the Complainant’s right arm n,In the result as I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the SO and the other officers who participated in the operation that resulted in the Complainant’s arrest conducted themselves lawfully throughout the incident there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1138
2020,Barrie Police Service,,Ontario,n r\n While there is discrepancy in the accounts of the witnesses interviewed by the SIU which included those of the Complainant the SO and a couple of civilian eyewitnesses there is sufficient clarity in the evidence to resolve the criminal liability issues In the afternoon of June 29 2020 officers were dispatched to a domestic disturbance call at an address on Courtney Crescent A neighbour had called the police upon hearing a female crying from the home saying that she needed to go to the hospital and accusing a male of hurting her and a male replying that “[I can’t.” From a second-floor balcony at the rear of the house the Complainant jumped to the ground below and made his way to a wire mesh fence that separated the house on Courtney Crescent from the neighbouring property to the east The SO was the first officer at the scene He was immediately directed to the rear of the property by a paramedic – CW 2 – who had preceded his arrival The SO ran between the homes on Courtney Crescent and tackled the Complainant to the ground Within moments the SO had handcuffed the Complainant and taken him into custody There is conflict in the evidence regarding the Complainant’s location when he was first physically engaged by the SO Some evidence indicates that the Complainant had just placed a foot onto the fence when the SO first made contact with him The SO in evidence confirmed by other evidence says that the Complainant was already on the opposite side of the fence when he caught up with him and took him to the ground.\n,Based on information he had received upon being dispatched in relation to an assault in progress and what he gathered at the scene suggesting the perpetrator of the assault was fleeing police I am unable to reasonably conclude that the SO did not have a lawful basis for seeking to arrest the Complainant,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1002

2019,OPP,,Ontario,n r\n The events in question are largely apparent on the weight of the evidence collected by the SIU which included interviews with the Complainant several WOs who participated in the operation culminating in the Complainant’s arrest and one of the two SOs – SO 2 As was his legal right SO 1 declined to interview with the SIU or authorize the release of his notes The investigation further benefitted from a review of data downloaded from a CEW discharged during the incident and video footage of parts of the arrest captured by a police drone Shortly after 11:00 a.m on September 23 2019 members of an OPP TRU team were mobilized to deal with a situation in the Town of Ingleside at an address on Dafoe Road Local OPP officers had earlier that morning attended at the address to arrest the Complainant for mischief to public property Upset at the township over a municipal grievance the Complainant had intentionally dug up the roadway in front of his home Greeted with profanity the sound of a shotgun being racked and a threat by the Complainant that he would not be taken alive the officers had left the property in the interests of everyone’s safety OPP Emergency Response Team officers were then deployed to surround and contain the property pending the arrival of the TRU Within an hour of being notified of the incident the TRU team were further advised that the Complainant was holed up in his residence with a gun and refusing to come out The OPP set up a command post near the intersection of Dafoe and Aultsville Roads From that location the TRU team commander and a couple of Critical Incident Commanders developed a plan whereby the TRU team would approach the property in an ARV first stopping to clear several outbuildings on the Complainant’s land before proceeding to the house Two snipers would also be set up in the outbuildings to monitor the Complainant’s movements in and out of the home reporting their intelligence to the other team members via radio SO 2 was the team leader With him were WO 6 – a dog handler with his dog WO 7 whose role it would be to discharge his CEW if necessary SO 1 tasked with wielding an ARWEN during the operation WO 3 responsible for operating the ARV and WO 5 and WO 4 Also in the ARV were trained crisis negotiators – WO 8 and WO 1 – and the PEW a tactical paramedic The outbuildings having been successfully cleared the ARV approached to within several metres of the front of the Complainant’s residence From that position with the use of the vehicle’s loudhailer WO 4 WO  8 and WO 1 the latter two in English and French repeatedly directed the Complainant to disarm himself and exit the home with his hands up Their entreaties were ignored as were WO 4’s efforts to attract the Complainant’s attention by periodically activating the vehicle’s emergency lights and siren One of the two snipers WO 2 reported that he could see the Complainant seated in the kitchen holding a long gun As the standoff continued the officers decided to deploy a throw phone next to the front door of the home in the hopes that the Complainant would collect the phone and use it to speak with police He did not A distractionary device was set off outside the home at about 3:22 p.m but it too failed to elicit a response from the Complainant At about 3:48 p.m with officers in and out of the ARV the Complainant emerged from the front of his home He was holding a loaded shotgun and walking toward the front of the ARV Multiple officers ordered the Complainant to drop his firearm and put his hands in the air to no effect As the Complainant continued forward SO 1 from a position in front of the Complainant fired his ARWEN multiple times The Complainant was struck dropped his shotgun and fell to the ground At SO 2’s direction WO 6 quickly released his dog who bit onto the Complainant’s lower right leg The Complainant kicked the dog away with his left foot and made it to his knees before his left arm area was bit by the dog The Complainant was on his knees with his torso bowed forward when WO 7 approached to within a metre or two of the Complainant and discharged his CEW into the Complainant’s back The Complainant immediately lunged forward onto his front but was not incapacitated He tucked his arms into his chest rolled quickly onto his back and then again onto his front his arms and legs moving throughout these movements WO 7 SO 1 WO 6 and WO 4 were surrounding the Complainant at this time standing over him The dog who had disengaged returned and bit into the right upper arm  shoulder area of the Complainant appearing to pull the Complainant a short distance on the ground The Complainant was temporarily back onto his knees before he appears to have been dragged back to the ground onto his right side by the dog shortly after which SO 1 from a kneeling position behind the Complainant on the ground delivered three punches to the Complainant’s back It was at this time that SO 2 arrived and entered the fray The Complainant’s upper body appeared to be prone on the ground and his arms close to his chest As SO 2 attempted to pry the Complainant’s left arm out from under him SO 1 punched the Complainant’s back a further four times The struggle persisted for a period in what was largely a wrestling match by this time punctuated some 25 and 38 seconds after the last of SO 1’s punches with two additional CEW discharges from WO 7’s weapon Shortly thereafter with WO 4’s help SO 2 managed to handcuff the Complainant.\n,Accordingly there is no basis for

2019,OPP,,Ontario,n r\n The weight of the reliable evidence gathered by the SIU gives rise to the following sequence of events Shortly after 9:00 p.m on March 30 2019 the OPP received a 911 call from the Complainant’s wife reporting that her inebriated husband had just threatened to kill her and their children Officers were dispatched to the home located in Minesing WO 6 was among the first officers to arrive at about 9:30 p.m From outside the home he observed the Complainant in the foyer make an aggressive movement toward his wife The officer identified himself and demanded that the door be opened The Complainant’s wife opened the door as the Complainant fled further into the residence Around this time the SO and WO 7 of the ERT were on scene Not knowing exactly what they were up against the decision was made by the ERT officers to back out of the residence remove the Complainant’s wife and her children to a safe location and set up containment around the home Over the next couple of hours led by the officer in charge at the scene WO 1 efforts were made to reach the Complainant Multiple phone calls were made into the home and a loud hailer was used to initiate contact all to no avail At about 11:00 p.m WO 1 consulted with a critical incident commander Advised to gather as much information as possible from the Complainant’s wife WO 1 spoke with her and learned that the Complainant had indicated he had a car full of gasoline which he would blow up with the kids inside At about 11:50 p.m together with a canine unit consisting of WO 2 and his PSD which had also been dispatched to the scene the SO WO 1 and WO 7 entered the home through the open front entrance The plan was to have the canine unit clear areas of the home in advance of the other officers entering to search for the Complainant The search party eventually made their way into a small bathroom on the second floor from which a small hatch-door in the wall led into an attic Looking in through the door the officers could see the Complainant lying on his back on insulation on the attic floor some metres away from them Having been located the officers advised the Complainant he was under arrest and directed him to approach the door The Complainant eventually rose to his feet but delayed in surrendering himself WO 2 repeatedly indicated that he would release the dog into the attic if the Complainant did not come out and then did so when his warnings went unheeded The dog latched onto the Complainant’s right arm causing the Complainant to fall on top of the dog WO 2 reached into the attic and managed to pull the Complainant out onto the bathroom floor at which point the dog released the Complainant’s arm and bit his lower right leg Shortly thereafter WO 2 released the dog’s grip on the Complainant and focused his attention on controlling the dog while the other officers dealt with the Complainant There ensued a brief but vigorous altercation in which the police officers resorted to force to deal with the Complainant who was uncooperative as they tried to secure him in custody The Complainant flailed his body kicked his legs and refused to give up his arms In response WO 7 kicked the Complainant’s right arm and punched him once in the shoulder WO 1 punched the Complainant once in the back and then deployed his CEW – to no effect  as the Complainant continued to struggle and WO 3 having arrived in the middle of the fracas punched the Complainant’s thigh and upper back The SO’s participation in the struggle remains unclear the officer having exercised his legal right to silence other than none of the other officers present in the bathroom saw him strike the Complainant The Complainant was eventually dragged out of the bathroom into open space where the officers were able to wrestle control of his arms and restrain them in handcuffs No further violence was exchanged between the parties.\n,Moreover whether on the basis of exigent circumstances pursuant to section 529,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=568

2019,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,n r\n The following scenario emerges from the weight of the reliable evidence collected by the SIU in its investigation which included video recordings from surveillance cameras that captured the Complainant’s flight from police and arrest Shortly before 10:00 p.m on March 18 2019 PRP received a 911 call reporting a theft in progress at 1235 Shawson Drive in Mississauga The Complainant was that person By the time of the officers’ arrival at the scene around 10:00 p.m the Complainant was still inside the van The Complainant refused to acknowledge the officers’ repeated requests that he exit the vehicle with his hands up The CW eventually arrived at the scene as well and provided the officers a key to the van which was used to open the side door of the vehicle As that occurred the Complainant rushed out the broken rear door window of the van onto a metal chain link fence immediately adjacent to the vehicle WO 2 among the officers who had gathered around the van deployed his CEW at the Complainant to no effect the Complainant managed to scale the fence and landed on the other side Once over the fence the Complainant ran in a southerly direction toward another fence and slid under it on his back feet-first but not before being targeted with another CEW deployment this time by WO 4 The deployment had no apparent effect and the Complainant resumed his flight from police running southeasterly across the rear yard of the commercial premises at 1261 Shawson Drive Officers ran after the Complainant including WO 8 with her police service dog WO 8 gave up the chase when the Complainant came up against and climbed over yet another fence at the east side of the business thereafter running southerly in the direction of Shawson Drive The SO followed the Complainant across the roadway caught up with him in the parking lot of the business at 1252 Shawson Drive and tackled him to the ground The officer was soon joined by WO 1 and WO 2 The Complainant struggled with the officers refusing to surrender his arms as they attempted to secure him in custody His resistance was met by CEW discharges by the SO and WO 1 For his part WO 2 delivered two to three knee strikes to the right leg and several punches to the right shoulder and side The officers eventually wrestled control of the Complainant’s arms and placed them in handcuffs behind his back The Complainant was lodged in a police cruiser and taken to the police station before being transported to hospital I am cognizant that there is some evidence painting a significantly different picture of the force used against the Complainant but this rendition is fundamentally flawed in key respects and cannot be trusted This rendition alleges that the Complainant had stopped when he was taken to the ground and that multiple officers kicked him in the face A video recording of the arrest captured by a surveillance camera in the area though not of excellent quality does establish that the Complainant was in fact still running when he was tackled by the SO The same video while showing a struggle of some sort between the officers and the Complainant whose details are largely indistinguishable does not depict kicking motions of the type and duration described.\n,On this record I am persuaded on reasonable grounds that the force in question progressed incrementally in step with the challenges the Complainant presented and therefore fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in aid of the arrest,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=543

2019,Niagara Regional Police Service,,Ontario,n r\n The material events in question are relatively clear on the weight of the reliable information collected by the SIU which included a video recording of the arrest captured by a civilian eyewitness’s phone In the afternoon of March 3 2019 NRPS officers made their way to a house on Maple Street in response to 911 calls about a stabbing at that location The Complainant had stabbed another tenant More than likely due to drug intoxication the Complainant was not of sound mind at the time he had high levels of cocaine methamphetamine and opiates in his system Uninvited and unexpected he had entered a man’s house and tried to take away the computer tablet he was using When the man demurred the Complainant produced a knife and stabbed the man at one point plunging the knife into the man’s lower right side The blade broke from the handle and remained inside the man The man attempted to defend himself by swinging a wooden chair at the Complainant and the Complainant jumped through a window shattering the glass in the process With the Complainant out of the house the man who was stabbed contacted 911 and explained what had just occurred The Complainant did the same with a cordless phone he had removed from the residence indicating that he was in fact the victim of an assault SO 1 SO 2 and SO 3 together with WO 1 WO 3 and WO 4 arrived at the scene They met with the Complainant on the driveway of the residence The Complainant reported that the man had been viewing child pornography on his tablet and had attacked him inside the home He also said his leg was broken a dubious claim as far as the officers were concerned as he was seen to walk without any difficulty While WO 1 and SO 3 waited outside with the Complainant SO 1 SO 2 and WO 3 went inside to speak with the man who was stabbed Viewing the knife stuck inside him and hearing his story the decision was made to arrest the Complainant Stepping outside the house SO 2 communicated as much to the officers waiting with the Complainant There followed a violent struggle between the Complainant and the officers Hearing that he was about to be arrested the Complainant attempted to flee but was quickly grabbed by WO 1 and brought to the ground The Complainant fought with the officers on the ground at one point ending up on top of WO 1 Other officers interceded and attempted to subdue the Complainant Despite the efforts of four officers the Complainant was able at one point to grab hold of WO 1’s firearm in its holster and pull up as if to retrieve it WO 1 gave verbal notice of what was happening to his fellow officers and pushed down as hard as he could on his weapon to prevent it being unholstered At word that the Complainant was attempting to disarm WO 1 SO 1 kicked the Complainant on the ground and delivered a flurry of punches to the Complainant’s head area numbering about 20 in total SO 3 who was holding a rifle reacted by using the butt end of his weapon to strike down on the Complainant’s hand four times SO 2 punched the Complainant in the head four to five times The officers were successful in having the Complainant release his grip on the firearm but he continued to struggle strenuously with the officers Despite his weight on top of the Complainant’s legs the Complainant was able to lift SO 3 off the ground Multiple and prolonged discharges from CEWs carried by SO 1 and SO 2 seemed to have little effect on the Complainant As the struggle continued over several minutes the Complainant managed to lift himself off the ground onto his hands and knees SO 1 delivered a series of knee strikes as did WO 2 who was also at the scene and joined the fray near its tail end With the arrival of WO 4 who sat on the Complainant’s right leg to hold him down the Complainant was eventually subdued and handcuffed with his hands behind his back The Complainant remained combative after he was restrained paramedics summoned to the scene delivered two doses of a sedative before he was sufficiently calm that he could be taken to hospital At the hospital the Complainant’s aggression returned and he had to be sedated again n,In either event I am satisfied that there remains no basis to proceed with charges against SO 1,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=689

2019,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,n r\n The following description of the circumstances surrounding the Complainant’s arrest is as far as it goes largely uncontested in the evidence gathered by the SIU The Complainant and his associate were occupants in a BMW vehicle being followed by undercover YRP officers They were the targets of an ongoing police investigation for property crimes While under surveillance they were observed entering a darkened home in Vaughan and then exiting with property in their possession When the undercover team confirmed that the back door into the home had been smashed upon the decision was made to arrest the Complainant and his associate for break and enter Additional undercover officers in unmarked vehicles were enlisted to track the movements of the BMW and assist in the pending arrests of its occupants At about 8:00 p.m on January 5 2019 as the BMW entered onto the driveway in front of the apartment building on Bathurst Street Toronto and stopped adjacent to the entrance to the building one of the undercover officers called for the BMW’s “takedown” WO 5 positioned his vehicle nose-to-nose in front of the BMW as SO 1 stopped his vehicle directly behind it WO 10 maneuvered her vehicle’s front end toward the BMW’s front driver door preventing it from opening The officers exited their vehicles and rushed toward the BMW some with firearms drawn They ordered the Complainant and his passenger to show their hands and exit their BMW It is here in the story that the evidence gives rise to competing accounts of what happened next The more incriminating account suggests that the Complainant raised his hands and tried to exit the BMW but was unable to because the driver’s door was pinned shut by one of the police vehicles At this point an officer reached through his half-open driver’s door window and punched the left side of the Complainant’s face three or four times The driver’s side door was eventually opened and the Complainant pulled out of the vehicle onto the ground This evidence further alleges that the Complainant was handcuffed quickly on the ground and then made to suffer multiple punches and knee strikes to various parts of his body including one particularly forceful punch to the head that temporarily knocked the Complainant unconscious It is further alleged that an officer used his foot to press the Complainant’s head into the pavement three or four times The scenario that emerges on the accounts of the police officers interviewed by the SIU stands in marked contrast to the evidence described above Far from raising his hands and surrendering peacefully to police when surrounded the Complainant is said to have immediately placed his BMW in reverse and squealed his tires in an effort to break free from the blockade Unable to escape the Complainant was forcibly removed from the driver’s seat after WO 10 moved her car allowing the officers to open the BMW’s driver’s side door The Complainant landed front first and lay prone on the ground the right side of his face exposed and his arms tucked underneath him SO 1 SO 2 and SO 3 surrounded the Complainant on the ground and repeatedly ordered him to release his arms When he refused to do so and fought against the officers’ efforts to yank them free SO 2 twice punched the Complainant’s head and shoulder area attempting to secure his compliance With the same objective in mind SO 3 delivered three to four punches to the Complainant’s face and when that did not work to help liberate the Complainant’s arms punched him three or four more times in the lower back A short while later the officers were successful in wrestling control of the Complainant’s arms and securing them in handcuffs behind his back No further force was used on the Complainant n,In the result while I accept that the Complainant’s nose was broken in his interaction with police officers during his apprehension and leave open the question whether one or more officers used excessive force against the Complainant in the course of what was otherwise a lawful arrest there are no reasonable grounds to proceed with charges in this matter given an absence of evidence over who precisely was responsible for that force,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=535
2019,York Regional Police,,Ontario,n r\n Thanks in large measure to video recordings of different aspects of the incident captured by private surveillance cameras in the area and in-cruiser video systems the circumstances surrounding the Complainant’s arrest are clear At about 3:15 p.m on January 3 2019 the YRP received a 911 call from the LCBO store at the intersection of Yonge Street and Davis Drive reporting a theft in progress The Complainant had reportedly left the store with an unpaid for bottle of liquor and was making his way eastward along Davis Drive Officers were dispatched to investigate WO 2 was among the first officers to arrive in the area He observed the Complainant running on the north side of Davis Drive and followed him in his cruiser The Complainant with a bottle of whisky in hand darted into westbound traffic toward the officer’s cruiser apparently as yet unaware of the presence of the officer He proceeded to drink from the bottle of whisky and was confronted by WO 2 The officer told him he was under arrest for theft encouraged him to surrender peacefully and then continued to follow the Complainant when he fled into westbound traffic and returned to the north sidewalk The Complainant continued to make his way east on Davis Drive as WO 2 drove onto the north sidewalk and pursued him at a distance At one point the Complainant fell onto the sidewalk picked himself up and proceeded to run into the intersection of Davis and Longford Drives The SO who was also responding to the theft in progress call entered the scene at this point He ran toward the Complainant and tackled him to the ground in the intersection WO 2 who had himself been chasing the Complainant in the area of the intersection made his way to the scene of the grounding and assisted in handcuffing the Complainant’s hands behind his back The Complainant was helped to his feet and seated in a public transit shelter in the vicinity where he waited while paramedics were called to the scene.\n,For the reasons that follow there are no reasonable grounds in my view to believe that the SO committed a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s arrest and injuries,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=547
2018,Peel Regional Police,,Ontario,n r\n While there is much in the evidence that is contested the following scenario appears common ground in the information collected by the SIU from various sources Those sources included statements provided by the Complainant a couple of witness officers who observed and participated in the arrest and several civilian witnesses to certain events preceding the arrest together with a review of data downloaded from a conducted energy weapon that was deployed and police notes and reports It should be noted that neither subject officer as was their legal right provided a statement to the SIU Shortly before 9:00 p.m on December 30 2018 WO 1 was parked in the parking lot of a restaurant in the area of Queen Street East and Hansen Road when he observed the Complainant leave the establishment and enter a red Chrysler 200 WO 1 was on patrol conducting RIDE investigations at the time and decided to follow the Complainant’s vehicle as it left the parking lot and proceeded east on Queen Street East WO 1 followed the Complainant’s vehicle while it made a series of turns While traveling south on Hansen Road the Complainant lost control of his vehicle 1 The Chrysler mounted the south side Orenda Road curb and struck a light pole causing substantial damage to the vehicle WO 1 witnessed the collision and notified the dispatcher that he was now in pursuit of the Chrysler as it proceeded east on Orenda Road The Complainant continued at speed making his way onto Rutherford Road before turning east on Steeles Avenue and then south along Highway 410 WO 1 pursued the Complainant for a couple of minutes At the direction of a sergeant who had been monitoring the pursuit the officer terminated the chase around the time the Complainant was entering onto the highway The Complainant continued driving until he abandoned his vehicle on Derry Road at the Highway 410 southbound ramp This is where the accounts in the evidence as to what happened next begin to part company There is some evidence that the Complainant made his way west toward the Petro Canada gas station located on the northeast corner of the Derry and Kennedy Roads intersection to call a towing company from that location Soon after his arrival he was confronted by SO 2 who told him to put his hands behind his back The officer then rushed the Complainant and placed him in a chokehold whereupon he slipped on some ice and fell to the ground The officer fell with the Complainant maintaining his chokehold while the Complainant lay prone on the ground The Complainant attempted to loosen the officer’s grip around his neck while another officer now known to be SO 1 arrived on scene That officer allegedly shot him with a conducted energy weapon causing his body to seize Around the same time SO 2 allegedly punched the Complainant in the face six or seven times This evidence suggests that other than the Complainant’s efforts to remove SO 2’s arm from his neck he did not resist his arrest WO 2 tells a different story of what occurred at the gas station According to the officer she arrived at the scene together with SO 1 and observed SO 2 and the Complainant engaged in a physical altercation on the ground SO 2 was on top of the Complainant who was on the ground with his arms tucked beneath his body refusing to give them up WO 2 says that SO 1 shouted at the Complainant to stop resisting his arrest When he refused to do so SO 1 discharged his conducted energy weapon at the Complainant following which WO 2 was able to assist SO 2 in fastening a handcuff on the Complainant’s left wrist According to WO 2 SO 1 discharged his conducted energy weapon again as the Complainant continued to refuse to give up his right arm after which she cuffed his right hand as well WO 3 arrived on scene shortly after WO 2 and witnessed the latter part of the Complainant’s arrest The officer says that the Complainant was lying on his back and moving from side to side in an effort to break free as SO 1 SO 2 and WO 2 were holding him to the ground and trying to secure him in handcuffs n,In my view there are no reasonable grounds to believe that either officer committed a criminal offence in connection with those injuries,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=553

2018,OPP,Bruce,Ontario,n r\n The events surrounding the Complainant’s injuries are clear on the information gathered in the SIU investigation which included statements from the Complainant the SO and a number of other police and civilian eyewitnesses,However given the volatility of the situation involving a belligerent person in close proximity to a couple of innocent bystanders and who continued to resist his arrest on the ground I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that the force used by the SO fell outside the latitude permitted by the criminal law,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=369

2018,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,n r\n The events surrounding the Complainant’s arrest are clear on the information collected by the SIU thanks in large measure to video recordings of the incident captured by a surveillance camera in the area and a camera affixed to one of the police cruisers At 3:20 a.m of August 26 2016 the Complainant parked his car along the western curb of Church Street and across from the McDonald’s restaurant located at the southeast corner of the Church and Queen Streets intersection He exited the vehicle walked across the road toward the restaurant and briefly engaged a group of people loitering on the sidewalk before entering the restaurant The Complainant was belligerent with the staff of the restaurant and was refused service Stepping outside he placed a call to police to report that he had been threatened with a knife by one of the males outside the restaurant TPS officers were dispatched to investigate WO 3 and WO 4 were the first to arrive in their cruiser at about 3:30 a.m The SO WO 6 and WO 7 followed shortly WO 3 established that no knife had been seen and that the disturbance amounted to a verbal interaction involving the Complainant and others As WO 3 spoke with the Complainant a male exited the McDonald’s restaurant and confronted the Complainant When it appeared the Complainant was moving forward to engaged the male WO 3 took hold of his right arm so as to prevent the situation from escalating The Complainant reacted by yanking his arm free and adopting an aggressive posture toward the officer WO 3 took hold of the Complainant’s head and directed him to calm down The Complainant would not and was then taken to the ground by WO 3 with the assistance of WO 4 WO 6 and WO 7 The Complainant struggled with the officers as WO 3 and WO 4 attempted to restrain him After several minutes had expired with the parties still on the ground the SO who to that point had been uninvolved as he occupied himself with keeping people back from the altercation and searching the Complainant’s vehicle approached and delivered what appeared to be a left knee strike to the left side of the Complainant Soon after the Complainant was handcuffed and placed in the rear seat of a cruiser He was transported to the police station and then to hospital when he complained that he was short of breath n,In conclusion as I am satisfied there is no reasonable basis for believing the force used by the involved officers including the subject officer was other than legally justified despite the injuries the Complainant may have suffered in the process there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this matter and the file is closed,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=505

2018,OPP,,Ontario,n r\n There is some uncertainty around the circumstances of the Complainant’s arrest as the SO declined to be interviewed as was his legal right and there is limited evidence about what occurred What is known of the transaction is gleaned largely from the evidence of the second arresting officer who was present throughout the interaction and and a civilian eyewitness who happened upon the scene namely WO 4 and CW 2 as well as the data downloaded from the CEWs that were used At around 1:40 p.m the OPP received a call of a theft that had just been committed at a convenience store in the Town of Bath WO 4 attended the store and reviewed a security video recording which depicted the Complainant committing the theft The officer made her way to the Complainant’s address and located him in a lot outside the rear of his residence WO 4 asked to speak with the Complainant about the theft but he was not interested in discussing the matter When the officer told him he was under arrest for the theft the Complainant’s ire escalated and he started to push and grab at the officer WO 4 tried to reason with the Complainant but his behaviour was undeterred Having attempted and failed to ground the Complainant the officer drew her CEW and threatened to use it if the Complainant did not desist He did not and was met with a CEW discharge aimed at his upper chest The deployment only temporarily immobilized the Complainant He continued to come at WO 4 grabbing her wrists prompting the officer to discharge her CEW a second time Again the Complainant locked up for a short period but quickly resumed his combative behaviour WO 4 called for assistance and the SO was soon on scene The SO arrived to find the Complainant holding WO 4 from behind in a bear hug of sorts When the opportunity presented itself the SO deployed his CEW and then again when the first deployment though meeting its mark proved ineffective When the second discharge was of similar effect the SO drew his baton extended it and struck the Complainant a number of times The Complainant was felled by the strikes but still kept his arms clenched tightly underneath him as the officers attempted to secure him in handcuffs The SO and WO 4 were eventually able to wrest control of the Complainant’s arms and place him in handcuffs The Complainant was placed in the SO’s vehicle and then with its arrival an ambulance for transport to the hospital.\n,Accordingly there is no basis to proceed with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=427
