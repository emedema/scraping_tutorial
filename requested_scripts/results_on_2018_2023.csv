,,Ingersoll,Ontario,He was taken to hospital with a fractured back and possibly other injuries,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.There is no evidence of any want of care on the part of theSO.  Having observed the Mercedes-Benz pass him at dangerously high speeds, the officer was within his rights in trying to stop the vehicle to issue an offence notice.  He too accelerated to about 180 km/h to try and narrow the gap with the Mercedes-Benz but only for a short period.  Realizing that the Mercedes-Benz was still pulling away, theSO, wisely, decided to disengage in the interests of public safety, slowing and bringing his cruiser to a stop by the side of the highway.  The officer was three kilometres away from the eventual site of the collision, which he came upon minutes later after receiving permission from theOPPcommunications centre to continue eastward.On the aforementioned-record, I am satisfied that theSOcomported himself with due care and regard for public safety, including the Complainant’s safety, throughout his brief engagement with the Complainant.  As such, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas engaged in the lawful exercise of his duties when he spotted the Jeep and attempted to stop it.  He had reason to believe that its occupants had just been involved in an act of violence involving the discharge of a firearm.With respect to the manner of theSO’s driving from the moment he observed the Jeep and tried to stop it until the collision, I am satisfied that the officer comported himself with due care and regard for public safety.  Indeed, the evidence indicates that theSOwas several hundred metres back of the Jeep when the collision occurred.  Nor does it appear that theSOtravelled at reckless speed or otherwise endangered the motorists around him.  He had his emergency equipment activated and topped out at about 90 km/h.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law in his brief engagement with the Jeep prior to the collision, there is no basis to proceed with criminal charges in this case.

,,Durham,Ontario,The Complainant was transported to hospital with a severed arm and multiple fractures,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas within his rights in seeking to stop the Complainant for speeding and operating a motorcycle without a licence.With respect to the officer’s driving from the point of his initial intervention to the time of the collision, I am satisfied that theSOcomported himself with due care and regard for public safety.  Appreciating the Complainant’s particular vulnerability on a motorcycle and the fact that it did not appear he was going to stop, the officer acted prudently in refusing to pursue the vehicle as it sped away from him.  Thereafter, theSOcontinued eastward on Highway 2 in the direction of the Complainant to see where he was going, but was well back of the motorcycle as it approached the Highway 418 intersection and then crashed.  It is true that theSO’s speeds were also north of 100 km/h as he neared the collision site, but it would appear this occurred near the tail end of the Complainant’s flight from the cruiser, or even after he had crashed.  There is also no indication of the officer’s speed having manifestly placed other motorists in harm’s way.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law in the events culminating in the Complainant’s collision, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

Both require something more than a simple want of care to give rise to liability.  The former is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  The latter is premised on even more egregious conduct that demonstrates a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  It is not made out unless the neglect constitutes a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable standard of care.  In the instant case, the question is whether there was any want of care on the part of any police officer, sufficiently serious to attract criminal sanction, that endangered the Complainant’s life or contributed to her medical episode.  In my view, there was not.The Complainant was lawfully in police custody at the time of the events under investigation.  She was discovered residing at an address in contravention of a condition of her bail and was subject to arrest on that basis.As for her time in police custody, I am satisfied that the officers who dealt with her and were responsible for her care comported themselves with due regard for the Complainant’s health and wellbeing.  The record up to the point she was able to access the bottle of cleaning solution suggests she was regularly monitored in her cell.  The fact that she was able to access the cleaning solution in the manner she did, by slipping her arm through the gap between the floor and the bottom of the cell door, is a matter of some concern, but I am unable to visit these failings on any of the Complainant’s custodians during her time in custody.[3]Nothing less than continual, uninterrupted monitoring of the Complainant could have avoided that contingency from materializing, and I am not satisfied that such oversight was called for in the circumstances.  Nor would it appear that the involved officers failed to act with the requisite dispatch once alerted to the Complainant’s plight.  As soon as she learned of the possibility that the Complainant had consumed a cleaning solution,WO#2 acted with haste in having her condition checked and arranging for medical intervention.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any officer transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law in the course of the Complainant’s time in custody, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

It is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the question is whether there was a want of care on the part of theSO, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the Complainant’s injuries.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas lawfully placed and in the execution of his duties throughout his brief engagement in the events culminating in the Complainant’s fall.  He arrived quickly at the address and, appreciating that time was of the essence if they were going to prevent further harm coming to the Complainant, acted with dispatch in trying to gain access to the interior of the residence.  Regrettably, the Complainant acted so quickly that there was little, if anything, the subject official, or any of the other officers on scene, could do to prevent him jumping from the window.  Indeed, it is not entirely clear that the Complainant was even aware of the police presence when he broke the bathroom window and jumped.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law in relation to the Complainant’s fall and injuries, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Essex,Ontario,Paramedics were called to the scene and transported the Complainant to hospital where he was diagnosed with multiple fractures and a subarachnoid hemorrhage,"The offences that arise for consideration are dangerous driving causing bodily harm and criminal negligence causing bodily harm contrary to sections 320.13(2) and 221 of theCriminal Code, respectively.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability in respect of either offence.  The former, for example, is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  The latter is premised on even more egregious conduct that demonstrates a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  It is not made out unless the neglect constitutes a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable standard of care.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which the officers engaged with the Complainant, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.Though there are aspects of the manner in which theOPPofficers engaged with the Complainant that are subject to legitimate scrutiny, they fall short of establishing a marked departure from a reasonable standard of care in the circumstances, particularly when weighed against a number of extenuating considerations.  In particular, as far as the officers knew, the Complainant andCW#1 were wanted for property-related offences, a point made by the sergeant supervising the pursuit on a couple of occasions when ordering his officers to stand-down.  And yet, the officers continued to press the issue even when it was clear the trucks were not about to stop.  In so doing, the officers risked personal injury coming to themselves, the Complainant andCW#1, and third-party traffic.On the other hand, it would be going too far to conclude that the officers involved on the roads with the Complainant andCW#1 explicitly defied the supervising sergeant in persisting with their efforts to stop the pick-up trucks.  On the occasions thatWO#3 had directed his officers to discontinue pursuit, he subsequently conveyed authority, whether tacit or explicit, to continue with their intervention efforts.  This is precisely what occurred when the sergeant, asked byWO#4 whether she was approved to attempt a rolling-block, provided that approval.  It is also what took place ahead of theSOdeploying his spike belt at the conclusion of the pursuit when, just before that occurred,WO#3 broadcast that the officers had one more opportunity to stop the pick-up trucks.It is also fair to say that the conditions that prevailed at the time of the pursuit were not clearly or necessarily prohibitive.  If the offences for which the Complainant andCW#1 were property-related, they were on the serious end of the spectrum – including ‘hit and runs’.  Moreover, while the roads were wet, there was little traffic on the roadway - an important factor in assessing the reasonableness of the spike belt deployment by theSO.  On this point, it is important to note that the Complainant’s loss of control and eventual crash does not appear to have been caused by the spike belt deployment; that is, the evidence suggests his pick-up truck did not traverse the spike belt.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to conclude that theSO, or any of the officers who had a role in the pursuit that preceded the Complainant’s motor vehicle collision, transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Niagara,Ontario,r\n\nCause of Death The pathologist at autopsy was of the preliminary view that the cause of the Complainant’s death was attributable to a ‘penetrating crossbow bolt injury to head’,"The offence that arises for consideration is criminal negligence causing death contrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is reserved for serious cases of neglect that demonstrate a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  It is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the question is whether there was a want of care on the part of anyOPPofficer, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the Complainant’s death.  In my view, there is no such misconduct disclosed in the evidence.The officers who convened on the property and then entered the home were lawfully placed throughout the police operation that culminated in the discovery of the Complainant.  They had been called to the scene by residents of the home fearful that the Complainant might do harm to them and himself, and were duty-bound to do what they reasonably could to prevent that harm from materializing.I am also satisfied that the police comported themselves, in the design and implementation of their plans of action, with due care and regard for public safety, including the health and well-being of the Complainant.  The first priority was to contain the situation and ensure the safety of the Complainant’s family members.  This they accomplished in short order soon after the first officers’ arrival at the scene and with the establishment of a perimeter around the house.  They then made every effort to communicate with the Complainant.  Regrettably, whether because he was already incapacitated or simply unwilling, none of those measures were successful.  When those efforts had run their course and it became apparent that the Complainant could or would not answer, the decision was taken to enter the home.  I am unable to faultWO#1 or any of the officers under his ultimate command for waiting as long as they did before adopting a more proactive posture.  The police had been advised that the Complainant was unstable and had access to multiple long guns, crossbows, and knives in the house.  In the circumstances, they were within their rights in exhausting all communication efforts from outside the home before they ventured inside.  As they still could not be sure of the Complainant’s status or intentions, the tactical officers acted reasonably when they first deployed robotics and the dog to see if the Complainant could be located ahead of their advance.  On this record, the evidence does not give rise to any concerns that the police failed to act with the necessary dispatch.It remains unclear at the end of the investigation when precisely the Complainant inflicted his mortal wound with the use of the crossbow.  It is possible that might have occurred before the arrival of any police officer at the scene.  Be that as it may, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any of the officers who took part in the police operations that day transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Essa,Ontario,The Complainant had suffered a fractured jaw in the process,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.There are aspects of theSO’s conduct that are disconcerting.  His speeds, substantially in excess of the 80 km/h speed limit, were inherently dangerous, topping out at one point at 200 km/h.  The fact that theSOtravelled at these speeds to stop a vehicle for a traffic offence – speeding – is also troubling.  When those circumstances are coupled with the fact that the officer did so in apparent contravention ofOPPpolicy forbidding unmarked vehicles from partaking in a pursuit, prohibiting pursuits for non-criminal offences, and requiring that pursuing officers broadcast their actions and the actions of the pursued vehicle to their communications centre, I am satisfied that theSOwas not only in seeming breach of policy, but an objective danger to other users of the roadway.Notwithstanding theSO’s serious indiscretions, however, I am not satisfied that the officer’s conduct departed markedly from a reasonable standard of care such as to render it criminal.  Pursuant to section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act, police officers engaged in the execution of their duties are exempt from the speed limitations.  This does not mean that officers are free to speed as they wish – public safety is always their primary obligation.  However, it is a mitigating factor in the reasonableness analysis required by the criminal law.  It is also important to note that theSOhad activated his emergency lights and, for the latter portion of the pursuit, his siren, and appears not to have caused other motorists to take evasive action.  Finally, it is not entirely clear to what extent theSO’s driving had a causal impact on the crash.  I accept that theCWdrove recklessly in part, at least, to get away from theSO’s cruiser, but it is worth noting that she seems to have been engaged in a course of dangerous driving even before her run-in with the officer.In the final analysis, when theSO’s driving behaviour is considered in its totality, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that the officer transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  As such there is no basis for moving forward with charges in this case.Date:	March 9, 2023Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=2336

,Toronto Police Service,Kingston,Ontario,CW 2 was fortunate to have escaped serious injury,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas in the lawful discharge of her duties when she decided to stopCW#2 and initiated a pursuit to do so.CW#2 was operating his vehicle dangerously and was subject to sanctions for his driving indiscretions.Having made the decision to pursue, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOfailed to comport herself with the care and regard required of the criminal law.  There are two aspects of the officer’s conduct that merit particular scrutiny.  First, having decided to activate her emergency equipment to pursueCW#2, she should have promptly notified her communications centre of what she was doing.  This puts senior officers in the position of monitoring a pursuit with the authority to terminate it if necessary on public safety grounds.  TheSO’s failure to do so effectively precluded this fail-safe from operating.  Second, theSOtravelled through an amber/red light at Rexdale Boulevard without stopping, and without the use of her siren.On the other side of the ledger, theSOdid have her emergency lights operating for most of her engagement withCW#2, giving notice to other motorists in the vicinity of the pursuit.  Her speeds were at times high but never grossly in excess of the speed limit over any extended period of time.  She did travel through a red light, but the light had just changed to red from amber as she entered the intersection.  Lastly, it is important to note that the officer’s interventions were short-lived in time and distance – about a kilometre-and-a-half and under a minute.  During that period, there is nothing to suggest that theSOunduly pushed or fueledCW#2’s reckless driving.In the result, as I am not satisfied that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.There is little doubt that theSOis responsible for the collision.  The Complainant had the right-of-way and the officer was legally obligated to refrain from turning left until he could do so safely.That said, I am unable to reasonably conclude on the evidence that the officer’s conduct amounted to a marked departure from a reasonable standard of care in the circumstances.  He says that he simply did not see the Complainant and believed his path was clear as he travelled into the crosswalk.  I am left to take theSOat his word as there is nothing in the evidence, aside from the collision itself, to suggest that the officer was distracted when he ought not have been.  For example, the evidence indicates he was not engaged at the time with his mobile workstation.  TheSOsays that the spotlight and radar mounts inside his vehicle may have impeded his vision.  In different circumstances, that evidence might attract criminal sanction if the officer was aware of the sightline obstructions and had done nothing to rectify the situation.  There is insufficient evidence of that having happened in this case.  In the final analysis, I am satisfied that the officer’s indiscretion may fairly be characterized as a momentary lapse of attention, which, as the case law makes clear, will generally not be enough to ground criminal lability.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law with respect to the collision he caused, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,London Police Service,Horton,Ontario,The most serious injury was one to his left ear much of which had been ripped off by the police service dog,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.The Complainant was subject to lawful arrest at the time theSOreleased the police service dog.  There were a number of warrants out for his arrest, he had violated the terms of a release order requiring that he abide by a curfew, and he had been operating a stolen vehicle and trailer.I am also satisfied that theSO’s decision to send the police service dog after the Complainant constituted a legally justifiable use of force.  Police dogs are among the tools at an officer’s disposal to locate and capture subjects attempting to conceal themselves or flee from arrest.  The Complainant was doing just that.  The evidence indicates that he was aware, at least at several discrete points during his travels that day, that the police were after him.  On each of these occasions, the Complainant had made it clear that he was not inclined to surrender into police custody.  Against this backdrop, having been located trying to hide on the grounds of the townhouse complex, and having fled notwithstanding theSO’s direction to the contrary, the use of the police service dog to thwart the Complainant’s flight would appear a reasonable tactic in the circumstances.  There was some urgency in taking the Complainant into custody, and a real risk that he might successfully escape if not for the dog.The fact that the police service dog caused injury to the Complainant also raises questions of possible criminal negligence.  Certainly, any time a police dog is deployed in these types of circumstances, there is potential for injury to the subject.  As I understand it, police dogs are trained to bark and hold when a subject stops their flight and effectively surrenders.  Where that does not happen, a police dog is expected to bite and hold pending the arrival of the dog handler.  The number of bites should be the minimum required to subdue a subject, and the neck and head area are to be avoided.  In the instant case, the Complainant suffered a gruesome injury – his left ear was severed – at the hands of the dog.  He was also bit multiple times.  There is a claim put forth that the Complainant offered no resistance to the dog.  That evidence is contested to an extent by the police evidence.  Be that as it may, I am satisfied the evidence falls short of any reasonable belief that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law in connection with the use of the dog.The offence that arises for consideration in this context iscriminal negligence causing bodily harmcontrary to section 221 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is reserved for serious cases of neglect that demonstrate a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  It is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  Had there been any notice of a real risk that the police service dog would, without warrant, inflict the type of serious injury suffered by the Complainant, there might have been an articulable case for liability under this section.  However, having examined the dog’s history and training, no such flags were raised.  As far as the evidence suggests, the police service dog was fully certified and qualified for a deployment of this nature.  On this record, the evidence does not meet the threshold of criminal negligence when it comes to theSO.In the result, while it is highly regrettable that the Complainant was injured in the way he was by the police service dog, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcomported himself other than lawfully throughout their engagement.  As such, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,,Ajax,Ontario,He was diagnosed with multiple liver lacerations,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the Complainant’s injuries.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas engaged in the lawful execution of his duty when he decided to attempt to stop the Tahoe on Delaney Drive.  By that time, police had received multiple reports of the Complainant’s reckless driving. He was a clear danger on the roadway, and police were entitled to respond to the area to do what they reasonably could to stop the Tahoe and take the Complainant into custody.Having made the decision, I am satisfied that theSOcomported himself with due care and regard for public safety.  The maneuver he specifically chose – a roadblock - clearly carried risks.  It was attempted on a residential street in use by motorists and pedestrians at the time.  On the other hand, it bears repeating that there was some urgency to stopping the Tahoe – it had been reported driving dangerously since it fled the scene near Salem Road and Gillett Drive.  Given the few seconds in which the officer had to think about it, I am not persuaded the calculus was prohibitive of the course he adopted.  In bringing his cruiser to a stop, it should also be noted that theSOleft sufficient room for the Tahoe to pass him if he was bent on circumventing the block.  In fact, by the time of the collision between the vehicles, the cruiser appeared to be in its proper lane of travel for the most part. Regrettably, perhaps because it might have initially appeared to the Complainant that the cruiser was positioning to block the eastbound lane, he moved into the westbound lane and struck the cruiser.  Be that as it may, if that is in fact what occurred, the collision is as much the result of the Complainant’s desperate decision-making at the time as anything the officer did.With respect to the Complainant’s collision with the tree, the facts speak for themselves.  He was at that point operating a vehicle without a front tire, lost control and crashed.  The nearest police cruiser –WO#2’s vehicle – was about 15 seconds west of his location at the time.  On this record, it is evident that the police did nothing to cause or contribute to the collision that could attract criminal sanction.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law in his engagement with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	January 27, 2023Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=2284
,Toronto Police Service,Dufferin,Ontario,He was taken to hospital and diagnosed with facial fractures,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in whichSO#2 andSO#1 operated their vehicles, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collisions.  In my view, there was not.There is no suggestion in the evidence that either of the subject officials drove dangerously until the final stages of their engagement with the Charger.  While they both exceeded the speed limit,SO#2 attempting to keep up with the Charger andSO#1 trying to catch up, it does not appear that other motorists were placed at undue risk by their conduct.The focus of the analysis centres on the officers’ decision-making in the moments before the collisions.  During this time, when it appeared that the driver of the Charger had clued into the presence of the police around him and sought to accelerate away,SO#2 tried to block the Charger’s path of travel and then, withSO#1, pursued the Charger at speed on the shoulder of Highway 401.  Those decisions certainly resulted in danger on the roadway – the former contributed to a crash between the two vehicles, albeit a relatively minor one; the latter might be said to have fueled the driver of the Charger’s reckless driving in some measure while constituting risky conduct in and of itself.  That risk, at least in the case ofSO#2, would have been exacerbated by the lack of any emergency lighting or siren on the officer’s vehicle.On the other side of the ledger, however, it is important to recognize that police officers engaged in the execution of their duties are exempt from speed limitations by section 128(13)(b).  The provision does not provide officers carte blanche to speed as they wish, but it does recognize that a measure of speed is sometimes necessary in the interests of law enforcement.  That is to say, an officer must weigh the situation and exercise judgment in deciding what is warranted in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the law enforcement interest was high.  As far as they knew, the driver of the Charger had just shot and wounded another individual, and remained in possession of a firearm.  His immediate apprehension was a matter of urgency.  To be sure, attempting to stop the Charger in the middle of a congested highway was always going to be a risky proposition.  However, the officers had a choice to make – attempt to stop and then pursue the vehicle, or risk having the driver get away.  In the heat of the moment, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the decision they made was a markedly unreasonable one. Rather, it would appear that the balance of public safety considerations was not manifestly prohibitive, particularly when the pursuit, as it turned out, was relatively short-lived.In the final analysis, when the risks inherent in the conduct of the subject officials are weighed against the extenuating considerations, I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that either ofSO#2 orSO#1 transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law in the course of their engagement with the Charger.

As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas within his rights when he decided to stop the Chevrolet and initiate a pursuit to do so.  The Complainant had gone past the officer travelling over 150 km/h northbound on Highway 416, well in excess of the speed limit.  At that speed, theSOwould have had grounds to believe that the Complainant was ‘stunt driving’ contrary to section 172 of theHighway Traffic Act, and possibly even ‘driving dangerously’ in violation of section 320.13(1) of theCriminal Code.  He clearly was a danger on the roadway.Driving at speeds well over 200 km/h on Highway 416, theSOwas himself a danger on the roadway.  He did so over an uninterrupted stretch of about 50 seconds.  Adding to the danger was the failure on the part of the officer to activate his emergency lights and siren for much if not all of this period.  That equipment is meant to provide other users of the roadway notice of an officer’s vehicle, giving them time to safely react to the situation.  Nor did theSOgo over the radio with the speeds he was doing.  Had he done so, it would have allowed a senior officer to monitor the situation and gauge from a dispassionate position the merits of continuing at that speed.On the other side of the ledger, there is no evidence to suggest that other motorists, whether on Highway 416 or Dilworth Road, had to take evasive action to avoid theSO’s cruiser.  In fact, as soon as theSOcame upon a line of traffic ahead of him, he activated his emergency lights.  That action appears to have alerted the motorists to his presence, who reacted by keeping to the right and slowing down as the officer overtook them in the passing lane.  One must also bear in mind that officers are exempt from the speeding laws while operating police vehicles in the course of their duty by virtue of section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act.  The section, though it does not provide carte blanche to officers to speed as they wish, does provide them a level of immunity in recognition of their law enforcement role.  In this case, one would have expected theSOto travel in excess of the speed limit to some extent if he was going to make any ground on the Complainant after he sped past the officer.  Lastly, aside from perhaps setting the stage for the Complainant’s continued speeds, there is no evidence that theSO’s conduct – his velocity, in particular – played any real role in the collision that occurred.  The officer was about 300 metres away from the Complainant when he crashed into the hydro pole.  Indeed, it is arguable whether the Complainant was ever even aware of theSO’s presence behind him.As for the environmental conditions at the time, these were largely neutral as public safety considerations.  Traffic was minimal, the roads were dry, and the weather was clear.When the aforementioned-considerations are weighed in the balance, I am satisfied that theSO’s conduct, if dangerous at times given his speeds, fell short of transgressing the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  As such, there is no basis for proceeding with charges in this case.

As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  Rather, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction and, if so, whether the impugned conduct caused or contributed to the collision involving the Complainant and his e-bike.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas in the execution of his lawful duties as he arrived on scene, located the Complainant, and attempted to detain him for investigation.  Given what he knew of the call that had been received by police, the Complainant’s presence in the location on a bicycle, and his subsequent donning of a mask and flight from the officer, I am satisfied there existed a constellation of circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that he was implicated in a theft.I am further satisfied that theSOcomported himself with due care and regard for the Complainant’s safety as he pursued him in his cruiser.  The officer activated his emergency lights and made use of his siren, alerting third-parties in the area of his presence and leaving little doubt of his intention to stop the Complainant.  Though theSOaccelerated to over 100 km/h at one point travelling north on Bank Street, there would have been little if any traffic on the roadway at the time, nor is there evidence of other motorists or pedestrians having been imperiled by the officer’s speed.There is a version of events proffered in the evidence that the officer used his cruiser to knock the Complainant off his e-bike, but I am unable to place any weight on the assertion for a number of reasons, including the fact that there is no damage on the officer’s cruiser consistent with such contact.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to conclude that theSOtransgressed the limits of care in his dealings with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Toronto Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,nCause of Death The pathologist at autopsy was of the preliminary view that the Complainant’s death was attributable to gunshot wounds of the torso,"Section 34 provides that conduct that would otherwise constitute an offence is legally justified if it was intended to deter a reasonably apprehended assault, actual or threatened, and was itself reasonable.  The reasonableness of the conduct is to be assessed in light of all the relevant circumstances, including with respect to such considerations as the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon; and, the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force.  In my view, the use of lethal force bySO#1 andSO#2 fell within the ambit of justification prescribed by section 34.The officers who responded to the scene, includingSO#1 andSO#2, were engaged in the lawful discharge of their duties.  Upon receiving word of an individual walking freely in the area of a school with a firearm, the officers dispatched to the scene were obliged to attend to do what they could to protect public safety and take the person into custody.The evidence establishes thatSO#1 andSO#2 fired their weapons at the Complainant in the reasonable belief that doing so was necessary to protect against a lethal threat.  Though neither officer, as was their right, provided a statement to theSIU, the circumstances surrounding the shooting compel the conclusion.  The Complainant had in his possession a rifle that gave every appearance of being able to inflict grievous bodily harm or death if fired.  He had been ordered to drop the weapon but did not do so.  Instead, the Complainant raised the weapon in the general direction of the officers, most pointedly atWO#6, as if about to fire.  On this record, it is evident that the officers shot the Complainant in the genuine belief that they were about to be fired upon.It is also apparent the gunfire bySO#1 andSO#2 constituted reasonable defensive force.  The weapon in the Complainant’s possession was an air rifle, but the officers would not have known that, nor, had they known, is it clear they could be assured it was non-lethal.  For all intents and purposes, the officers would have reasonably apprehended that their lives were on the line when the Complainant very deliberately raised the rifle at them.  That is whatWO#6, similarly situated toSO#2, told theSIU.  He explained that he was about to fire his gun at the Complainant in fear for his life whenSO#1 andSO#2 discharged their weapons.  Nor was it the case that retreat or withdrawal were options.  The Complainant constituted a real and present danger to public safety, particularly given his proximity to a school that was in session, and the officers were not free to vacate the area.  Lastly, confronted with a lethal weapon at a distance of approximately 20 (SO#2) to 40 (SO#1) metres, I am unable to fault the officers for not resorting to less lethal weapons.  What was required was the Complainant’s immediate incapacitation, something only a firearm could do given the officers’ locations.In the result, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that either ofSO#1 andSO#2 comported themselves unlawfully when they confronted and shot the Complainant.  As such, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	September 23, 2022Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=2133

Once in the lawful custody of the police, the officers were entitled to exercise reasonable control of his movements to ensure the Complainant’s safety as well as theirs.With respect to the force used by theSO, namely, a grounding, I am unable to reasonably conclude that it was unjustified.  The Complainant was intoxicated, belligerent and combative.  He had tried to kick theSOand was attempting to break free of the officers’ hold.  The officers were entitled to resort to a degree of force to protect themselves and maintain custody over the Complainant.  A grounding in these circumstances seems a reasonable decision – in that position, the officers would have the upper hand in dealing with any continuing resistance on his part.  Nor does it appear the grounding itself was needlessly aggressive or heavy-handed.  It is regrettable that the Complainant’s face impacted the ground in the process and that his nose was fractured, but there is no suggestion that theSOintended that result or that the Complainant’s injury was anything other than the by-product of an inherently dynamic process fueled in large measure by the Complainant’s resistance.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcomported himself other than lawfully in his engagement with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against the officer.

,Barrie Police Service,Barrie,Ontario,Following his arrest the Complainant was taken to the station and then to hospital where he was diagnosed with a concussion and forehead laceration,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.The Complainant was subject to police apprehension at the time of the events in question.  There was at least one warrant in effect authorizing his arrest.With respect to the force used by the arresting officers to take the Complainant into custody, I am satisfied that it was legally justified. TheSO’s tackle of the Complainant would appear on its face a proportionate and reasonable tactic to thwart the Complainant’s attempt at flight to avoid arrest. Thereafter, given the nature and extent of the Complainant’s physical resistance on the ground, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the limited number of punches struck by theSOandWO#6 were excessive. Following the last ofWO#6’s two to three blows, the officers were able to wrestle control of the Complainant’s arms and handcuff them behind his back. No further strikes were delivered.There is a version of events proffered in the evidence that the Complainant did not resist his arrest and was needlessly punched several times byWO#6. This evidence, however, cannot stand in light of eyewitness evidence that described the Complainant vigorously resisting arrest. Indeed,CW#1 was so concerned with the Complainant’s fight thatCW#1 called 911 to alert police of the situation.In the result, while I accept that the Complainant’s laceration was inflicted in his tackle to the ground and that the concussion was the result of his head hitting the sidewalk or one or more of the punches delivered by the officers, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the officers who arrested the Complainant comported themselves other than lawfully.

Based on what the officer knew of the calls for service that had been received by the police, and what he was able to ascertain directly by briefly speaking with a person from Baskin-Robbins as he arrived at the plaza parking lot, who pointed the Complainant out to the officer, I am satisfied that the Complainant was subject to lawful arrest on a weapons charge.I am also satisfied that the quantum of force used by theSO, though significant, fell within the bounds of legally justified force.  The officer had cause to believe that the Complainant was in possession of a firearm and that, therefore, it was imperative to arrest the Complainant as quickly as possible.  In the circumstances, when he flailed his arms while on his backside in the direction of the officer, theSOwas entitled to respond with a measure of force to weaken and subdue the Complainant.  Most problematic was the use of theCEWto strike the Complainant in the head, which the officer did on three or four occasions.  TheCEW, however, was in his hand after he had retrieved it to attempt to stun the Complainant into submission, which efforts had failed.  And its use to strike the Complainant appears to have occurred right after the Complainant’s left arm seems to have been in proximity to the weapon, suggesting the officer was concerned he was reaching for it.  On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the use of theCEWin this manner was excessive, particularly as the Complainant continued to struggle against the officer’s efforts after theSOre-holstered the weapon.  In arriving at this conclusion, I am mindful that officers caught up in volatile and dangerous situations are not expected to measure their responsive force with precision; what is required is a reasonable response, not an exacting one:R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1SCR206;R. v. Baxter(1975), 27 CCC (2nd) 96 (Ont. CA).For the foregoing reasons, while I accept that the Complainant’s broken nose was the result of the force used by theSO, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the injury is attributable to unlawful conduct on the part of the officer.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Ottawa Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,n r\n The following scenario emerges from the evidence collected by the SIU which included statements from two civilians struck by a less lethal round video footage from a variety of sources that captured the incident in parts and a written statement from SO 2 As was their legal right neither subject official chose to interview with the SIU In the evening of February 19 2022 SO 2 and SO 1 members of the VPD-Emergency Response Team were participants in a police operation involving a crowd of protesters that had gathered on Bank Street south of Sparks Street Specifically they were there to support Public Safety Units officers including from the VPD who had formed in the intersection to push back the protesters south on Bank Street The objective was to direct the crowd back a distance so that a safety fence could be erected on the roadway The front line of the protesters which numbered on some estimates in the thousands were face-to-face with the front line of police officers The atmosphere was tense as the parties physically engaged and pushed back against each other A number of arrests were made Complainant 1 and Complainant 2 were among the crowd of people at the protest They had climbed atop a concrete barrier beside the McDonald’s restaurant on the east side of Bank Street Beside them was another male whose identity remains unknown with a flashlight in hand The male shone the flashlight into the eyes of the police officers SO 1 was armed with a less lethal firearm – an L140-4 He observed the male shining the flashlight and discharged his weapon in his direction on multiple occasions One of the rounds struck the face of the male He was knocked off the concrete barrier and disappeared into the crowd Another of SO 1’s discharges struck Complainant 2 and Complainant 1 following which they climbed down the barrier and left the area SO 2 was armed with an ARWEN In order to deter protesters moving towards officers some of whom had fallen in the push forward the officer fired his ARWEN striking one such protester in the leg He fired his weapon a second time at another protester who had been fighting with police officers and was moving again towards the front lines r\n\r\n,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.SO#2 andSO#1 were part of a lawful police operation to control the crowd that had gathered on Bank Street.  The plan was not to shut down the gathering, but simply to direct the protesters a short distance south so that safety fencing could be erected across the road.  Those in the crowd had repeatedly been directed to move south before the officers began their push forward.  On this record, I am satisfied that the involved officers were engaged, at minimum, in a reasonable and legitimate exercise of police powers at common law to maintain public order and safety.I am also satisfied that the force used by the officers – the deployment of their less lethal firearms – was legally justified.SO#1’s round were aimed at a man who was intentionally aiming a flashlight in the faces of the officers, presumably to interfere with their vision.  Given the man’s distance from the front lines of the police, it would have been impractical and perhaps even dangerous to wade into the crowd to deal with the man directly.  The use of theARWENwould appear to have been a reasonable tactic in the circumstances.  Indeed, following the last of the officer’s discharges, the man was knocked off the concrete barrier and apparently was no longer a factor in the events that followed.[2]As for the shots fired bySO#2, these too were commensurate with the exigencies of the moment.  They were directed at the legs of two protesters who seemed on the verge of physically engaging with the officers, including officers who were on the ground at the time.  In both instances, the force succeeded in deterring the protesters, presumably without the infliction of serious injury.For the foregoing reasons, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that either subject official comported themselves unlawfully in the use of their less lethal firearms.

The officers, having investigated the assault call and spoken with the alleged victim, had reason to believe that he had just perpetrated a violent assault with the use of a weapon – a pair of scissors.I am further satisfied that the nature and extent of the force used by the officers in aid of the Complainant’s arrest was legally justified.  When the Complainant ran from the officers on Yonge Street and then ultimately onto Harlandale Avenue, it was clear that he was intent on evading apprehension.  The use of theCEWbySO#2 appears to have a reasonable tactic if the officers were going to catch the Complainant without inflicting serious injury.  Once on the ground, there is no doubt that the strikes delivered bySO#1 amounted to significant force.  That said, he andSO#2 were up against an individual strenuously resisting arrest whom the officers had cause to fear could be armed with a weapon.  It was imperative in the circumstances that the Complainant be subdued as quickly as possible.  In this context, I am unable to reasonably conclude thatSO#1 used excessive force.  Indeed, it was only after the final blow had been struck that the Complainant uttered words to the effect of, “Alright, alright,” indicating he was prepared to surrender at that time.  The same may essentially be said of the kicks thatSO#3 seemingly delivered as the struggle on the ground was unfolding.  Lastly, the grounding that occurred asSO#1 andSO#2 were escorting the Complainant to their cruiser was made reasonably necessary by the Complainant’s continued resistance.  Though handcuffed, he had attempted to pull free from the officers, and then continued to struggle against their efforts to bring him within their control.  A takedown in such circumstances made sense in order to quell the Complainant’s fight and place him in a position where the officers could better manage his combativeness.In the result, while I accept that the Complainant’s serious injuries were incurred in the physical altercation that marked his arrest, there are no reasonable grounds to believe they are attributable to unlawful conduct on the part ofSO#1,SO#2 and/orSO#3.

,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital and diagnosed with a fractured nose,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.The evidence establishes that theSOused no more than reasonably necessary force in taking the Complainant into custody.  The tackle from behind is understandable given the Complainant was running away from the officer and seemingly had no intention of stopping.  Thereafter, the punches andCEWdischarges, I am satisfied, were proportionate responses in the context of a physical altercation with a man who had sprayed the officer with pepper spray and was vigorously attempting to break free of theSO’s hold.  The officer’s eyesight was deteriorating at the time, and it was imperative that he do what he could to quickly take the Complainant into custody.TheSOasserted that his intention in pursuing the Complainant was to arrest him for drug possession and trespass under theControlled Drugs and Substances Actand theTrespass to Property Act, respectively.  With respect to the former, I am not satisfied that the officer had the grounds to effect a lawful arrest.  The time of day, his understanding that the GO station was closed, his knowledge of the area as being high in drug crime and what he believed he observed to be a hand-to-hand transaction of some sort - considerations theSOreferenced to justify his decision - would seem to fall short of establishing reasonable and probable grounds for an arrest.  In particular, the exchange the officer had witnessed among members of the group was made from a significant distance and described in terms sufficiently vague to undermine its probative value.I am also not entirely convinced that theSOhad compelling grounds to justify an intervention based in trespass, but here at least it would appear the officer had an arguable case.  Section 2 of theTrespass to Property Actprovides, in part, that it is an offence to enter onto premises without the express permission of the occupier where such entry is prohibited.  Entry is “prohibited” under the Act where the premises are “enclosed in a manner that indicates the occupier’s intention to keep persons off the premises”: see subsection 3(1)(b).  In the instant case, it is clear that the Complainant had entered onto a parking lot of the GO station, the parking lot was fenced on some if not all of its borders, it was completely vacant, and the vehicle entrance/exit was blocked by a rope rail of sorts.  Whether or not this series of factors would satisfy a court that the Complainant was, in fact, trespassing, I am satisfied that it provided the officer a reasonable basis for concluding he had the requisite grounds to make a lawful arrest.In the result, while I accept that the Complainant’s injury was the result of the force used against him by theSO, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that it was attributable to unlawful conduct on the part of the officer.

There is no suggestion that the Complainant was unlawfully in the custody of the police.  The police had information from his partner that the Complainant was intoxicated and driving a vehicle.  Nor is there any suggestion that theSOfailed to comport himself with due care and regard for the Complainant’s well-being at any time.  He andWO#2, aware that the Complainant was impaired by cocaine use, watched him carefully and promptly called for medical care at the first sign of acute medical distress.  In fact, the Complainant had been in the custody of the police for not longer than about 40 minutes – 20 minutes of which were in the police station – before an ambulance was called.For the foregoing reasons, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any of the Complainant’s custodians, including theSO, transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

,Toronto Police Service,Grey,Ontario,They were taken to hospital having suffered multiple fractures,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  Simple negligence is insufficient to ground liability for the offence; rather, what is required, in part, is a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care on the part of theSOin the manner in which he drove, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.TheSO’s speed as he neared St. Clair Avenue – about 95 km/h – is subject to legitimate scrutiny.  The roads were damp and slippery at the time, and the ‘gun call’ that he was responding to was no longer a matter of pressing urgency.  It had been about a half-hour since the initial call had come in, and it was not even clear where the suspect might be located at the time.  In the circumstances, it is arguable that the officer was travelling in excess of what was reasonable at the time.  Indeed, at the speed at which he was travelling, almost twice the 50 km/h speed limit – forensic calculations suggest he had left himself little to no opportunity to avoid a collision with someone entering the intersection as Complainant #1 did – a foreseeable contingency that theSOought to have had in mind.On the other side of the ledger, however, there are a number of extenuating considerations that render theSO’s driving something less than a marked departure from a reasonable standard of care.  As an officer in the execution of his duties at the time, theSOwas exempt from the speed limitations pursuant to section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act.  While the provision does not confer carte blanche on police officers to speed as they wish, it does provide that allowance be made in the reasonableness assessment of an officer’s conduct in recognition of their unique law enforcement role.  It is also apparent that theSOwas not oblivious to public safety considerations as he made his way to the scene of the call for service – St. George Subway Station.  In fact, while en route to his destination prior to the collision, theSOhad operated his cruiser at reasonable speeds and in compliance with the traffic laws, which included coming to a stop at two stop signs and two red traffic lights before he safely cleared those intersections.  He also had his cruiser’s emergency lights on for the duration of the trip (and his siren as he neared St. Clair Avenue on Avenue Road), affording surrounding motorists and pedestrians notice of his presence and speed on the roadway.  Indeed, the footage captured by the cruiser’sICCSdepicts other vehicles, in both directions of travel, pulling over for theSOas he travelled south towards St. Clair Avenue.  Lastly, while theSO’s speeds in the final stages of his route before the collision were high, they were not excessively high.  That is to say, if the ‘gun call’ had become stale to an extent, it remained a priority call deserving of an expedited response given the potential presence of a firearm in a public setting.  What a reasonable speed would have been in the circumstances is difficult to ascertain with precision,[2]but I am confident that it was something more than the 50 km/h speed limit and something less than the speed at which theSOtravelled in the moments prior to the collision.  I am even more confident that the difference between those two figures would not reflect a blatantly disproportionate response on the part of the officer to the situation at hand.For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that theSO’s driving did not transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

,,Kawartha Lakes,Ontario,The Complainant was transported to hospital and treated for a 12-centimetre laceration across the left front of the neck,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.The officers who responded to the 911 call made byCW#1 were at all times lawfully placed and in the execution of their duties throughout their engagement with the Complainant.  An officer’s foremost duty is the protection and preservation of life.  Aware that the Complainant was inside his mother’s residence in possession of a knife and intending to harm himself, the officers were duty bound to do what they reasonably could to prevent that from occurring.I am also satisfied that the force used against the Complainant, in substance, aCEWdischarge by Officer #1, was legally justified.  Though it is unclear in the evidence whether the Complainant still had possession of the knife when he was subjected to theCEWdischarge, the fact is he had just used it to self-inflict a serious neck wound.  In light of his recent possession of the knife, the speed with which events unfolded, and the need to immediately incapacitate the Complainant lest he be in a position to continue to harm himself or, possibly, the officers, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the singleCEWdeployment was excessive in the circumstances.Aside from theCEWdischarge, it should further be noted that there is no evidence of any want of care on the part of the involved officers that caused or contributed to the Complainant’s injury.  The officers acted reasonably in first establishing a perimeter around the home in the interests of public safety.  The Complainant was apparently of unsound mind at the time and in possession of a knife, and the officers were right to be concerned about possible risks to third-parties should the Complainant leave the home.  Thereafter, though efforts were made to have a negotiator attend the scene, their hands were forced when the Complainant was seen cutting his neck.  At that point, reasonably, in my view, Officer #1 and Officer #2 decided to physically engage the Complainant to prevent him doing further harm.  Indeed, but for their efforts, it might well be that the Complainant would have suffered an even more serious, and potentially lethal, fate.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any of the involved officers comported themselves unlawfully in their dealings with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges.

In my view, there was not.The officers were in the lawful execution of their duties when they decided to pursue the Complainant for a traffic infraction.  They had observed her travelling well in excess of the 60 km/h speed limit on Main Street West and performing a reckless U-turn at speed.Thereafter, in the context of a very brief pursuit in time and distance – not more than a minute and several hundred metres – I am satisfied that theSOcomported himself within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  The officer did exceed the speed limit, at times traveling in excess of 100 km/h, but did so with his emergency lights activated (giving notice of the pursuit to other motorists and pedestrians in the area), in clear and dry conditions with little traffic on the road, and in circumstances in which a burst of acceleration was to be expected if he was to catch up to the Complainant and attempt a traffic stop.  The evidence also indicates that theSOandWO#1 travelled through the red light at West Side Road / Highway 58 having decelerated as they approached the intersection, but without fully stopping as they were legally obligated to do.  The indiscretion was significant but not enough, standing alone or in combination with the other evidence, to constitute a marked departure from a reasonable standard of care, particularly as there was minimal traffic on West Side Road / Highway 58 and the officers were well back – upwards of a hundred metres – from the Complainant’s vehicle at the time.In the result, there are no reasonable grounds on the aforementioned-record to believe that theSOdrove dangerously in violation of the criminal law.

The Complainant was in mental crisis and of unsound mind at the time.  He had armed himself with two edged-weapons intending to do himself harm, and had embarked on that course as police confronted him in the basement of his home.  Time was clearly of the essence if the officers were going to prevent serious harm or death coming to the Complainant.  In the circumstances, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the discharge of five less-lethal rounds from theARWENandCEWdeployments were excessive as they stood to immediately incapacitate the Complainant without inflicting grievous bodily injury.  In fact, that is what occurred.  The Complainant’s hand with the box cutter in it was promptly drawn away from his neck.  And theCEWdischarges were successful in bringing the Complainant to ground, where his position of relative disadvantage meant the officers could move in to safely take him into custody.  Given his resistance on the ground, it would appear that a furtherCEWdischarge, this time applied in drive stun mode, was also reasonable given the imperative to quickly subdue the Complainant and render medical care to his serious wounds.As for the officers’ conduct in and around the home preceding the Complainant’s arrest, and their decision to enter the residence when they did, there is no evidence to suggest that the subject officials, or any of the involved officers, failed to comport themselves with due care and regard for the Complainant’s health and well-being.  Having received reports from the Complainant’s therapist expressing concern for his safety, the police were duty bound to respond to the address to do what they reasonably could to prevent harm coming to the Complainant.  Once on scene, they attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the stand-off, and only entered upon reasonably concluding, based on what they were being told by the therapist, communicating with the Complainant at the time, that the Complainant was on the brink of self-harming.  On this record, I am satisfied that the police interventions likely had more to do with saving the Complainant’s life than they had to do with the serious neck injuries he inflicted on himself.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the subject officials conducted themselves unlawfully throughout their engagement with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	March 9, 2022Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1875

,Ontario Provincial Police,Bruce,Ontario,r\n\nCause of Death The pathologist at autopsy was of the preliminary view that Complainant 2’s death was attributable to ‘multiple blunt impact trauma’,"The offences that arise for consideration are dangerous driving causing death and criminal negligence causing death contrary to section 320.13(3) and 220 of theCriminal Code, respectively.[2]The former is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  The latter is reserved for serious cases of neglect that demonstrate a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  It is not made out unless the neglect constitutes a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable standard of care. In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the conduct of theSO, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision.  In my view, there was not.The officers who responded to the intersection of Camp Oliver Road and Grey County Road 4 to try to stop the pickup truck from entering into Durham, including theSO, were in the lawful execution of their duties at the time.  They had reason to believe that Complainant #3 was operating a stolen pickup truck with reckless disregard for public safety, and were right to be concerned about what would happen should it enter into the populated area of Durham – about five kilometres away.I am also satisfied that the decision to deploy the spike stick was a reasonable one.  A police pursuit or the use of police vehicles to stop the pickup truck was off the table as Complainant #3 had in prior encounters with the police failed to stop when signaled to do so and rammed other vehicles.  In the circumstances, the use of a spike stick had the potential to safely bring the pickup truck to a stop if it worked as intended, namely, to create a gradual and controlled tire deflation.  The location the officers had chosen to execute the tactic – a rural road that ran straight for a couple of kilometres - was also ideal as it would mitigate the risk to public safety in the event the tire deflation resulted in a loss of control by the driver.Mitigate - not eliminate – as there was always going to be risk in any decision taken by the officers.  They could have decided to do nothing and hope that Complainant #3 would reduce his speed and alter his reckless driving as he approached Durham.  However, the officers had no reason to think he would do that.  By the time they got involved, Complainant #3 had embarked on a protracted course of dangerous driving.  Indeed, with no police officers pursuing or following him, he travelled at speeds upwards of 150 km/h en route to the site of the spike stick.  Perhaps the officers ought to have arranged to stop eastbound traffic for a distance behind them before deploying the spike stick to further reduce the risk.  However, events were unfolding quickly and it was not long before the pickup truck was on them – time was not on their side.  In the face of these difficult choices, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the tactic they adopted was unreasonable or, if it was so, that it was markedly unreasonable.With respect to the speeds reached byWO#4,WO#3 and theSOas they accelerated after the truck following the spike stick deployment, I am satisfied that the officers did not transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  These speeds, as theGPSdata from theSO’s cruiser establish, reached as high as 175 km/h, well in excess of the 80 km/h speed limit.  That said, there is no indication of other users of the road being directly imperiled by the cruisers, nor does it appear that the officers fueled Complainant #3’s flight from police.  The evidence indicates that Complainant #3 was bent on driving at incredible speeds, with or without police officers behind him, and that the officers were never so close to the pickup truck so as to prevent Complainant #3 reducing his speed, had he been so inclined.For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that theSOand the other WGPSofficers comported themselves with due care and regard for public safety with respect to their involvement in the series of events that culminated in the tragic death of Complainant #2 and serious injury of his daughter.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	March 7, 2022Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1861
,Ottawa Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,Paramedics attended and transported the Complainant to hospital where he was diagnosed with internal head injuries,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his cruiser, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the collision between the officer’s vehicle and the Complainant.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas in the lawful discharge of his duty as he travelled to the site of the collision.  He was responding to a high priority call at the Shoppers Drug Mart in Merivale Mall involving a reported armed robbery in progress.As for the officer’s driving in the parking lot, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOfailed to comport himself with due care and regard for public safety.  If the officer drove somewhat in excess of what might be considered reasonable in a parking lot in ordinary circumstances (22.5 km/h), these were not ordinary circumstances - theSOwas responding to a serious call for service in which speed was of the essence.  The fact that theSOalso did not have his emergency lights activated in the parking lot – limiting the notice pedestrians and motorists in the vicinity had of his presence – is also mitigated by the nature of the call for service; the responding officers would not have wanted to tip off a possible suspect in the Shoppers Drug Mart of their arrival.  It should also be noted that the Complainant crossed the access road north of the crosswalk that was designated for that purpose.It remains unclear at the end of the investigation why neither theSOnor the Complainant appear to have taken any steps to avoid the collision.  Be that as it may, the most that may be said about the officer’s apparent failure to detect the Complainant and alter his driving to prevent an impact is that it amounted to a momentary lapse of attention.  This, as the case law makes clear, is not enough to transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

,LaSalle Police Service,Amherstburg,Ontario,The Complainant was diagnosed with internal head injuries and multiple fractures,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.   The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle that contributed to the Complainant’s injuries and/or was sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas in the lawful discharge of his duties when he tried to stop the Complainant’s pickup truck.  In light of the information about the Complainant’s reckless driving provided via dispatch, and what he observed for himself, the Complainant was a clear danger on the roadway and theSOwas within his rights in attempting to pull him over.Thereafter, in the course of a relatively brief engagement with the truck over a rural, straight stretch of roadway, the evidence indicates that theSOcomported himself with due care and regard for public safety.  The officer engaged the Complainant at moderate speed and used his emergency lights judiciously to warn oncoming traffic of the dangers posed by the pickup truck.  TheSOcannot be faulted for the series of events that resulted in the Complainant falling from a moving vehicle.It remains uncertain whether one or more of the Complainant’s injuries were incurred in his fall from the pickup truck, or whether they were the result of his misadventures throughout the day.  Reportedly, he had been involved in several motor vehicle collisions prior to his encounter with theSO.

,Toronto Police Service,Durham,Ontario,r\n\nCause of Death The cause of the Complainant’s death remains pending further studies at this time,"The offences that arise for consideration are failure to provide the necessaries of life and criminal negligence causing death contrary to sections 215 and 220 of theCriminal Code, respectively.  The former is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  The latter is reserved for even more serious cases of neglect – ones that demonstrate a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  It is not made out unless the impugned conduct consists of a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable standard of care.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care on the part of theSO, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction, that caused or contributed to the Complainant’s death.  In my view, there was not.There is no suggestion in the evidence that the Complainant was unlawfully in custody at the time of the events in question.  Based on the information at the officers’ disposal, I am satisfied that the Complainant was lawfully arrested on October 13, 2021.The Complainant did not appear entirely well when he was arrested and then booked at 43 Division, and the question arises whether his custodians ought to have sought medical attention.  He was unsteady on his feet, had bruises and swelling to various parts of his body, and talked about experiencing numbness.  The officer-in-charge at the time the Complainant was brought in -WO#3 - was cognizant of his condition and did not believe that medical attention was necessary.  The Complainant had himself explained that his symptoms were not anything new.  Rather, they were the result of a reaction to the second dose of the vaccine he had taken weeks prior.  The Complainant indicated he had spoken with a pharmacist and was satisfied with the medical advice he had received, namely, that his symptoms would ameliorate over time.  Questioned further, the Complainant denied having consumed drugs and said his last alcoholic drink was the previous day.  As for his unsteadiness,WO#3 chalked it up to the swelling to the Complainant’s right ankle.  On this record, while it might perhaps have been advisable to send the Complainant to hospital for examination, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the failure to do so byWO#3 and, by extension, the other officers-in-charge who followed him during the Complainant’s stay in cells, including theSO, amounted to conduct that departed markedly from a reasonable level of care.The nature and extent of the supervision the Complainant received while in custody is subject to legitimate scrutiny, particularly from 3:30 a.m.  Before then, the Complainant had been seen moving and walking.  From that time forward, he was motionless.[2]One of the special constables assigned to monitor the Complainant during this time –SEW#3 – recorded checks at 3:47 a.m. and 4:16 a.m.  He said that the Complainant was sitting up during his check at 4:16 a.m.  That would not appear to have been the case.  Further checks of the Complainant later that morning bySEW#4 – seven in total - said to have been conducted through the cell door window or via video monitors, failed to disclose that anything was amiss.  According toSEW#4, the Complainant seemed to be sleeping comfortably and gave no indication that he was in distress.  It is apparent that the Complainant was not sleeping for at least some of these checks, if not all of them – he was experiencing an acute medical episode or was deceased.TheSOwas the officer-in-charge of the station from about 3:45 p.m. to 4:10 a.m., when he was relieved byWO#4.  Though ultimately responsible for the welfare of prisoners in their custody at the station, officers-in-charge are not directly tasked with performing cell checks; they rely on the booking and fingerprint officers - special constables in this case - to perform that function and alert them to any problems.  There is no evidence to suggest that either theSOorWO#4 had any reason to believe that the special constables were not discharging their duties in a reasonable and competent fashion.  Nor is there any reason to believe that they were ever notified by the special constables of any concerns regarding the Complainant’s condition during this period, which only makes sense – they apparently had no concerns about the Complainant’s condition, believing he was asleep or more active than he actually was.  In the circumstances, I am unable to visit any of the special constables’ indiscretions on the officers-in-charge, and certainly not to the extent of any reasonable conclusion that theSOandWO#4 failed markedly in their duty of care to the Complainant.For the foregoing reasons, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  Accordingly, though the cause of the Complainant’s death remains undetermined at this time, there is no reason to believe that it is attributable to any unlawful conduct on the part of the subject official.As theSIUhas no statutory jurisdiction to investigate special constables, the matter of their conduct in connection with the Complainant’s time in custody will be referred to theTPS.Date:	February 10, 2022Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1829
,,Chatham-Kent,Ontario,n r\n The material events in question are clear on the evidence collected by the SIU and may be briefly summarized As was his legal right the SO chose not to interview with the SIU He did provide a written statement and authorized the release of his notes At about 12:30 a.m of September 23 2021 a woman called 911 to report a home invasion in progress at her residence in Blenheim One of the intruders was identified by the caller as possibly being the Complainant Officers were dispatched to the address While travelling to the scene southbound on Kent Bridge Road the SO observed a vehicle – a silver Ford Fusion – travelling northbound towards him pull over in the area of Talbot Trail By this time officers responding to the scene had been informed that the intruders had fled the residence in a vehicle that contained a firearm The SO drove up beside the Ford only to see it re-enter the road and accelerate away northward The SO executed a U-turn and pursued the Ford on Kent Bridge Road Within a couple of minutes and about a kilometre south of Ridge Line the Ford came upon an ambulance travelling south with its lights and siren on The driver of the Ford travelled slightly onto the gravel shoulder on the east side of the roadway as the vehicles passed each other thereafter re-entering the lane and losing control The Ford slid off towards the east side of the road rolled over a couple of times and came to rest on its roof beside a row of trees on the property at 20113 Kent Bridge Road A male occupant of the vehicle quickly exited the wreckage and fled eastward The SO who was about four car lengths away from the Ford at the time of the collision brought his cruiser to a stop on the roadway beside the crash site He went to render assistance to the remaining occupants of the vehicle – the Complainant and CW 1 – and radioed for paramedics Though neither the Complainant nor CW 1 cooperated with the SIU the investigation suggests that the Complainant suffered a dislocated hip in the collision for which she may or may not have undergone surgery r\n\r\n,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  Liability for the offence is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the question is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which theSOpursued the Ford, that caused or contributed to the accident, sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas in the lawful execution of his duties when he decided to pursue the Ford.  By that time, the officer was aware the home invaders had fled the residence travelling eastbound in a vehicle.  In the circumstances, when the driver of the Ford, having initially pulled over, decided to accelerate away from theSO, the officer had grounds to believe he and the vehicle’s passengers were freshly fleeing from the scene of the crime.As for the manner in which the officer comported himself during the pursuit, I am satisfied that theSOdemonstrated due care and regard for public safety throughout.  The only real issue was with respect to his speeds during the stretch of time and distance that marked the pursuit – about five kilometres and two minutes – at times as high as 166 km/h.  This was significantly in excess of the 80 km/h speed limit.  On the other hand, theSOwas travelling over a straight road in good repair with very little traffic and his emergency lights and siren on.  He was also an officer in the lawful performance of his duties and therefore exempt from the speed limitations pursuant to section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act.  While the provision does not grant officers free rein to speed as they wish without regard to public safety, it is an important consideration in the reasonableness analysis, particularly in a case, like this one, in which the officer is pursuing in connection with a very serious criminal offence.  Finally, there is no evidence that the officer’s speed directly imperiled other users of the roadway.  On this record, I am satisfied on balance that theSOdid not transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law as he pursued the Ford.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOconducted himself other than lawfully throughout his brief engagement with the Ford Fusion, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Hamilton Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario,Paramedics at that location transported the Complainant to hospital where he was diagnosed with a fractured right ankle,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  The Complainant had fled the scene of an accident and was subject to lawful arrest under section 320.16(1) of theCriminal Code.The preponderance of the evidence indicates that the Complainant’s injury pre-existed his arrest by the police, and was caused by the motor vehicle accident in which he had been involved or his flight over steep, uneven, heavily treed terrain in the dark.  For example,WO#5, upon seeing the Complainant crossing Kenilworth Access in front of his cruiser, radioed that he was limping.Once confronted by the officers, the evidence indicates that they simply used their greater manpower to keep the Complainant pinned on the ground as they wrestled control of his arms to handcuff them behind his back - no strikes of any kind were delivered.  This would appear to have been a reasonable level of force given indications that the Complainant continued to offer a degree of resistance to his arrest on the ground.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant’s injury was associated with unlawful force on the part of the subject officials, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

In light of what they had observed of theCW(she was holding her face) and her complaint of assault at the hands of the Complainant, I am satisfied that the officers were proceeding lawfully to place the Complainant under arrest.As for the force that was used by the officers, namely, multiple knee and hand strikes to the Complainant’s upper body, I am unable to reasonably conclude that it was excessive.  The Complainant had led theSOandWO#1 on a spirited if brief chase, was fleeing from the scene of a freshly committed assault that he had seemingly perpetrated, and was physically resisting the officers’ efforts to take him into custody.  On this record, it would appear the officers had good cause to want to arrest the Complainant as quickly as possible, if necessary with resort to reasonable strikes to assist in their cause.  That, it would appear, is what occurred.  No strikes of any kind were delivered after the Complainant had been handcuffed.In the result, while I accept that the Complainant’s rib fractures were likely the result of the force used by theSO, I am not persuaded on reasonable grounds that the officer comported himself other than lawfully throughout their dealings.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Burk’s Falls,Ontario,It remains unclear which of the shots fired caused which wound and whether both or only one of the officers discharged the shots that resulted in the Complainant’s death,"Pursuant to section 34 of theCriminal Code, the use of force that would otherwise constitute an offence is legally justified if it was intended in the defence of oneself or another from a reasonably apprehended attack, actual or threatened, and was itself reasonable in the circumstances.  The reasonableness of the force is to be assessed against all the relevant circumstances, including such considerations as the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon; and, the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force.  There are no reasonable grounds, in my view, to believe that either of the subject officials acted without the legal justification of section 34 when they fired their weapons.At the outset, it bears noting thatSO#1 andSO#2 were lawfully placed throughout their engagement with the Complainant.  The officers had been called to the scene of a disturbance which had involved a level of violence.  They were duty bound to attend at the address to do what they could to assist in safely resolving the situation.I accept that both subject officials acted to thwart a reasonably apprehended knife attack at the hands of the Complainant when they discharged their guns.SO#2 provided a statement to theSIUin which he said he used force fearing for his life and the life ofSO#1.  There is nothing in the evidence to refute his assertion.  On the contrary, the circumstances support the officer’s claim and the reasonableness of his belief.  Moments prior,SO#2 had been fending off an assault by the Complainant as she swung at him with a knife through the open driver’s door window of his cruiser.  Now confronted again by the Complainant waving a knife in his direction and advancing on his position, I am satisfied thatSO#2 andSO#1 were at imminent risk of grievous bodily harm or death.ThoughSO#1 did not provide a statement to theSIU, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officer was not of the same mindset given the presence of the knife in the Complainant’s possession and her approach to within a few metres of the officers’ location with the weapon in hand.The situation in which the officers found themselves also persuades me that their resort to gunfire was not unreasonable.  The Complainant had in her possession a knife with a blade of some ten centimetres in length, clearly capable of causing death as she neared to within five metres of the officers.  She had also shown a propensity to use it, seconds earlier having attackedSO#2 with the knife.  Retreat or withdrawal were not realistic options in the circumstances.  In particular,CW#3, who had called police to report the Complainant, was standing in the vicinity of the Complainant throughout the final standoff before the shots and was clearly at risk in the event the Complainant decided to turn on him.  Finally, while warranting careful scrutiny, the number of shots fired – seven altogether – and the location of a wound in the Complainant’s back – are not enough to reasonably establish that either officer acted with excess.  In particular, the rapidity of the shots fired, the simultaneity of the gunfire, the angle of the officers vis-à-vis the Complainant, and the inherent dynamism of the moment, do not suggest that the risk reasonably apprehended by the officers changed materially at any point from shots one through seven.  On this record, I am satisfied that the officers acted reasonably when they sought to protect themselves from a potentially lethal attack with a resort to lethal force of their own.Some witnesses offered a version of events which, if true, could ground criminal liability, but it would be unwise and unsafe to rest charges on the strength of their evidence.  In particular, there was evidence the Complainant was simply standing in place when she was shot.  That evidence, however, is fundamentally undercut by the location of the Complainant’s body after the shooting, namely, by the rear driver’s side of the pickup truck.  The account, which had the Complainant by the front driver’s side of the truck at the time of the shooting, simply does not accord with where she ended up.  Conversely, and consistent withSO#2’s story, the evidence suggests that the Complainant had advanced on the officers’ position when she was shot.For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds thatSO#2 andSO#1 comported themselves lawfully throughout their tragic encounter with the Complainant.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	August 23, 2022Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=2095

Given what they had learned via dispatch of the 911 call that had come in fromCW#1, and whatSO#1 gathered firsthand of what had occurred fromCW#1 in the lobby of the building before attending the apartment, the officers had ample grounds to arrest the Complainant for assault.  Once arrested, the officers were also entitled to maintain the Complainant safely in their custody and to deal with him accordingly to law.Given the nature and extent of the Complainant’s physical resistance to his arrest and custody, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the force brought to bear against him by the subject officials was excessive.  Inside the apartment, the officers had cause to believe that the Complainant had just perpetrated a vicious assault resulting in possible death.  When the Complainant struggled as the officers attempted to secure him in handcuffs, they were entitled to respond with decisive force to ensure he was taken into custody as quickly as possible.  In the circumstances, the punch to the head and the knee strikes to the left leg, delivered bySO#2 andSO#1, respectively, were commensurate with the situation at hand.Once at the police station, the Complainant’s combativeness returned and he was met again with what, in my view, was reasonable force.  In the hallway en route to the elevator that would take them to theCIDoffice, the Complainant refused to travel forward and then wrapped his legs aroundSO#3 before he was forced to the floor, where he attempted to bite officers, kicked out his legs and refused to release his arms from under his torso.  The takedown bySO#2, in my view, was a reasonable intervention to remove the Complainant fromSO#3’s person.  Thereafter, I am unable to conclude that the force applied by the officers in the middle of a heated struggle to bring the Complainant under control was indiscriminate or disproportionate, particularly as the severalCEWdischarges had proven ineffective.Finally, with respect to the force used bySO#1 andSO#2 in theCIDholding cell, the former had just been kicked in the groin by the Complainant and the officers were entitled to take steps to deter any further violence.  In the circumstances, I am unable to characterize the knee strikes – one each bySO#1 andSO#2 - as gratuitous.  Following the blows, it is telling that the Complainant told the officers that he was done fighting.For the foregoing reasons, while I accept that the Complainant broke his ribs in the course of one or more of his physical altercations with officers,[1]there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any of the subject officials conducted themselves unlawfully in the course of his arrest and throughout his period of custody.

,London Police Service,London,Ontario,nCause of Death At autopsy the pathologist was of the preliminary view that the Complainant’s death was attributable to a perforating gunshot wound to the head,"The offence that arises for consideration is criminal negligence causing death contrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is reserved for negligent conduct that exhibits a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other, and results in death.  Simple negligence will not suffice to ground liability.  Rather, what is required is a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether theSO, in her leadership role, fell short in her duties and, if so, whether her shortcomings caused or contributed to the Complainant’s death and were sufficiently egregious as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there is no evidence to reasonably establish that theSOwas derelict in how she conducted herself.At the outset, it bears noting that the officers, including theSO, were lawfully placed in the park at the time of the Complainant’s death.  They were there in the discharge of their foremost duty as police officers, namely, the protection and preservation of life.  Having received the Complainant’s 911 call about his plans to die by suicide, the officers were duty bound to attend at the scene and make their best efforts to deter his self-destructive intentions.  Given that a firearm was involved, the police also had a duty to ensure the safety of others in the vicinity.Once positioned in the park, I am satisfied that the officers under theSO’s command conducted themselves with due regard for the health and safety of the Complainant and the public.  Efforts were quickly undertaken to clear the park of pedestrians, control vehicular traffic around the area, establish a perimeter around the Complainant, and place deflation devices under the tires of his vehicle, the lone one parked in the lot east of the observation deck.  Those initiatives were clearly necessary.  Though the Complainant had emphasized that he had no intention of hurting anyone other than himself, he was of unsound mind and armed with a gun.  For those same reasons, I am unable to fault the officers for maintaining a safe distance from the Complainant throughout their engagement, a fact which effectively foreclosed the potential use of less lethal weapons as a means of taking the Complainant into custody.  As for the efforts to negotiate a safe resolution of the matter, there is no indication in the evidence to suggest that they were remiss in any degree.WO#1, who led those talks, was a trained negotiator. He had managed to develop a rapport with the Complainant and kept him talking for just under an hour before the fateful shot.  As those negotiations were ongoing, efforts were even made to consult with an on-call psychologist with theLPSto assist with these types of situations.In the result, I am unable to reasonably conclude on the aforementioned-record that theSOand the officers under her command comported themselves other than professionally in their dealings with the Complainant.  Though the Complainant was able to make good on his intentions, that was through no fault of the involved officers.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against theSOand the file is closed.Date:	May 10, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1354

,Toronto Police Service,Horton,Ontario,Following his arrest the Complainant was taken from the scene to hospital where he was reportedly diagnosed with a fractured right forearm/wrist before being returned to police custody,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.  I accept that the Complainant was subject to arrest when he was first confronted byWO#2 andWO#1 in the Green P parking garage.  By that time, the officers had seen the Complainant on a security video recording of his time in a condo parking lot causing damage to vehicles – committing the offence of mischief – and knew what he looked like.  When he then proceeded to pull a knife on the officers, there were additional grounds to seek his arrest.With respect to the less-lethal rounds that were fired at the Complainant, one or the other of which likely caused his forearm/wrist fracture, I am satisfied that it was no more than was reasonably necessary to effect his arrest.  The Complainant was armed with a large knife that was capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death.  By outward appearances, he was also of unsound mind at the time and constituted a clear and present danger to himself and others.  He had advanced on police officers in a threatening fashion with the knife, and also held it to his neck and chest while saying he wished to do himself harm.  Moments before the shooting, he had pointed aCEWatWO#2.  Prior attempts to incapacitate the Complainant with the use ofCEWs had been ineffective, as had repeated verbal exhortations that he drop the knife.  In the circumstances, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO’s attempt to neutralize the Complainant from a distance with the use of her less-lethal shotgun was unreasonable.  While the officers might have continued to play for time, hoping the Complainant would unilaterally disarm himself without the need for force, he had already been given a reasonable opportunity to desist and there was a pressing public safety imperative to resolving the matter as quickly as possible in the interests of the Complainant’s wellbeing and others.  Indeed, even after the shots fired from theSO’s firearm, the officers exercised restraint by continuing to following the Complainant for several minutes without any additional resort to force, until he collapsed for reasons that remain unclear.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcomported herself other than lawfully in her encounter with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Sault Ste. Marie Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,n\nCause of Death The pathologist at autopsy concluded that the Complainant’s death was attributable to ‘stab wound of right neck’,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.The officers who engaged with the Complainant at 275 Albert Street East, including theSO, were lawfully placed at all times.  Having received reports of a male refusing to leave private premises, they were within their rights in attending at the address to deal with a possible trespass.  Once there and aware that the Complainant was in possession of a knife, in apparent violation of a probation order, the officers also had grounds to take the Complainant into custody.The force used by theSOand other officers, namely, multipleCEWdischarges, was legally justified.  The officers had reason to be concerned that the Complainant constituted a threat to himself and others.  In a previous and recent engagement withSSMPSofficers, the Complainant had similarly armed himself with a knife and used it to cut himself.  They were also aware that the Complainant was paranoid - in the course of his dialogue with the officers, he questioned whether they were actually police offices, mentioned that people were seeking to murder him, and explained that a piece of tinfoil on his head was meant to prevent others from intercepting his thoughts.  And residents of the building had gathered in the lobby to see what was happening, some of whom were screamed at by the Complainant, increasingly causing the officers concern about the public’s safety.  On this record, I am unable to fault the officers, reportedly acting on the instructions ofWO#1, when they discharged theirCEWs as the Complainant turned his back to them.   Though theCEWdischarges did not completely incapacitate the Complainant, who was able to lift his right hand with a knife in it and use it to inflict lethal injury, the use of theCEWs carried with it a reasonable prospect of neutralizing the Complainant from a safe distance.Nor does there appear to have been any want of care on the part of the officers in the manner in which they comported themselves prior to theCEWdischarges, such as might attract liability forcriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is reserved for serious of cases of neglect that demonstrate a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  It is not made out,inter alia, unless the impugned conduct constitutes a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, there is no indication that the officers ran afoul of the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  The evidence suggests that they spoke to the Complainant in reasonable terms, and tried to assist him with his travel plans for the evening.  It is true that they quickly ascertained that the Complainant might be labouring under mental illness, raising the question as to why the service’s Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team[3]was not deployed.  It seems that some of the officers gave thought to this contingency, but decided, reasonably in my view, that it was not a realistic option given the presence of a weapon in the Complainant’s possession.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSO, or any of the other involved officers, committed a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s self-inflicted knife wound and death, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Toronto Police Service,Grey,Ontario,n r\n The material events are clear thanks to security camera footage that captured the incident in its entirety Statements were also gathered from the Complainant several civilian witnesses and police witnesses who participated in the operation resulting in the Complainant’s arrest As was his legal right the SO chose not to interview with the SIU or authorize the release of his notes Shortly before 8:00 p.m of January 14 2021 the Complainant operating a red pickup truck with CW 1 as his passenger pulled into the parking lot of Church’s Texas Chicken on the north side of Eglinton Avenue East just east of Midland Avenue He stopped on the east side of the lot facing north adjacent to a convenience store whereupon CW 1 exited and made her way to the plaza west of the restaurant Shortly thereafter the Complainant decided to turn his vehicle around as he waited for CW 1 to return He drove further north and turned his truck such that it was positioned facing east in and around the northeast corner of the lot Before the Complainant could reverse to continue his 3-point turn a Dodge Charger drove up and came to a stop facing the driver’s side of the truck A Honda Accord did the same by the rear passenger side of the truck The vehicles were unmarked police vehicles and their occupants were there to arrest the Complainant for drug offences Moments earlier CW 1 had walked over to a car parked in the lot of the adjoining plaza where she joined a male inside the vehicle CW 1 provided the male a quantity of crack cocaine and received payment in return The male was an undercover police officer – WO 1 Immediately following the transaction WO 1 signaled that the deal had taken place after which WO 4 and WO 5 staged in the area approached the vehicle and arrested CW 1 At the same time other officers moved in with their vehicles to prevent the Complainant’s departure from the area and take him into custody The events of January 14 2021 were the culmination of a weeks’ long TPS Drug Squad investigation involving the Complainant and CW 1 WO 1 had previously arranged to purchase cocaine from CW 1 on January 2 and 5 2021 On each occasion the transaction occurred in the Midland Avenue and Eglinton Avenue East area CW 1 had been seen arriving in a red pickup truck with the Complainant on the latter date On January 14 2021 the Drug Squad obtained a series of search warrants naming CW 1 and the Complainant as targets of an ongoing drug investigation and authorizing the search of the Complainant’s pickup truck It was decided that both parties would be arrested that evening following the execution of the planned drug deal Upon seeing his truck surrounded by the two vehicles the Complainant accelerated in reverse across the north end of the restaurant toward the narrow laneway along the western end of the property The SO had exited his Accord by this time holding a CZ Scorpion rifle The officer aimed the firearm at the truck and yelled at the Complainant as he followed the vehicle westward across the rear of the restaurant He was joined by WO 6 who had stopped his vehicle behind the SO’s Accord and also exited with a sidearm in hand aimed at the pickup truck and yelling at its driver to stop The pickup truck continued in reverse and with its passenger side sideswiped the passenger side of an uninvolved minivan parked along the northwest corner of the restaurant before proceeding southward into the laneway As it did so the backend of the truck struck and then climbed onto the hood of a Hyundai Sonata WO 2 was driving the Sonata and moving forward through the laneway to prevent the truck’s escape when the collision occurred His pathway effectively blocked by the Sonata the Complainant accelerated forward several metres and struck the front end of WO 3’s Dodge Charger WO 3 had followed the Complainant in his vehicle as the latter initially reversed away from the officer The SO was a few metres in front of the pickup truck as it reversed and struck WO 2’s vehicle thereafter moving northward and out of the vehicle’s path as it began its forward travel again en route to striking WO 3’s Charger The officer discharged his rifle four times in rapid succession in and around the time of the second collision The Complainant’s right hand was struck by one of the bullets fired by the SO The fragment from another bullet struck the Complainant in the left knee Following the shooting the Complainant was removed from the pickup truck by WO 6 placed on the ground and handcuffed Paramedics attended the scene and transported the Complainant to hospital.\n,"Section 34 of theCriminal Codesets out the conditions under which force used in the defence of oneself or another is legally justified.  It provides that the application of force does not constitute an offence where it is intended to repel a reasonably apprehended attack, actual or threatened.  The force in question must also be reasonable in the circumstances, including with respect to such considerations as the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon; and, the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force.  I am unable to reasonably conclude on the evidence that the force used by theSOfell afoul of the section 34 justification.I accept that theSOfired his weapon believing it to be necessary to protect himself, and possibly others, from a reasonably apprehended attack at the hands of the Complainant.  Though the investigation was without first-hand evidence of the officer’s state of mind at the time, the circumstances surrounding the incident compel the conclusion.  By the time of the gunfire, theSOhad seen the Complainant operating his pickup truck in a desperate attempt to escape police apprehension. The Complainant had already struck a parked minivan and the vehicle of a fellow officer before it changed gears and accelerated in the officer’s direction from not more than a few metres away.  On this record, I am satisfied that theSOshot at the Complainant harbouring a real and legitimate concern that doing so was necessary to protect himself from an imminent risk of harm.  The issue turns to the reasonableness of theSO’s conduct.In my view, theSO’s resort to his firearm was a tactic reasonably available to the officer in the circumstances.  There is little doubt that the Complainant knew he was being confronted by police officers seeking to arrest him for a drug offence.  The emergency lights ofWO#3, which were on as he first approached the pickup truck’s driver side, and theSO’s vest with the word, “Police,” on the front, would have made that clear.  There is also little doubt in the evidence that the officers had lawful grounds to arrest the Complainant given the search warrants that had been obtained and the drug transaction that had just occurred.The Complainant failed to surrender and instead made it very apparent that he was determined to escape.  He pursued his cause with reckless abandon, his truck reversing intoWO#2’s vehicle, striking it violently and climbing onto the vehicle’s hood, the rear passenger’s side wheel coming within centimetres of the officer’s driver’s side windshield.  Thereafter, despite the presence of theSOdirectly in front of the truck, the Complainant accelerated forward off ofWO#2’s vehicle toward the officer.  As he did so, theSOmaneuvered to his right and found himself by the truck’s driver’s side as he discharged his weapon four times.  By this time, theSO, andWO#2 andWO#3, were essentially under assault by the Complainant wielding a dangerous weapon – a truck obviously capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death.On the aforementioned-record, given the speed and the confined quarters within which events unfolded, the latter rendering withdrawal an unrealistic option, I am satisfied that theSOwas within his rights in matching the deadly threat presented by the Complainant’s operation of the truck by lethal force of his own.  This is so notwithstanding the fact that theSOwas no longer in the path of the pickup truck when he fired his weapon.  In arriving at this conclusion, I am mindful that police officers embroiled in dangerous and dynamic situations are not expected to measure their defensive force with precision; what is required is a reasonable response, not an exacting one:R. v. Baxter(1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. CA);R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1SCR206.  Faced with a serious threat to life and limb, with only split seconds in which to react to a pickup truck moving toward him and little space within which to maneuver, I am unable to fault the officer for acting as he did in the heat of the moment.  Nor, given the rapidity of the shots, can it be said that the threat level the officer would have reasonably apprehended changed materially from shots one through four.This is another case in which an officer has placed himself in a position of danger in front of a motor vehicle attempting to flee from police, thereafter, resorting to a firearm to protect themselves.  In order to deter such conduct, in the interests of protecting the health and safety of their members and the community, including the target drivers,TPShas instituted a policy prohibiting officers from placing themselves in the path of an occupied motor vehicle with the intention of preventing its escape.  It is alsoTPSpolicy to prohibit its officers from firing at a motor vehicle or its occupants unless there exists an immediate threat of death or grievous bodily harm by means other than the vehicle.  This said, while theSOmay have acted improvidently, the officer did not lose the right to defend himself when the Complainant drove at him.  As I am satisfied that the Complainant did so intentionally, and was deliberately using his truck as a battering ram to break free of police vehicles and make good his escape, theSOwas within his rights in attempting to incapacitate the truck’s operating mind.For the foregoing reasons, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	May 13, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1346
,Toronto Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,The Complainant complained of pain while in custody and was taken in ambulance to hospital where he was reportedly diagnosed with a fractured shoulder blade a fractured collar bone and fractured left-sided ribs,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  The officers were acting on the strength of a warrant out for the Complainant’s arrest and were therefore within their rights in seeking to take him into custody.I am also satisfied that neitherSO#1 norSO#2 used excessive force in effecting the Complainant’s arrest.  The Complainant demonstrated that he was intent on evading arrest.  Confronted by officers, he immediately fled on foot west along the businesses that lined the southside of Wilson Avenue west of the Toronto Plaza Hotel.  In the circumstances, the officers were entitled to resort to a measure of force to bring the Complainant’s flight to an end.  The push that felled the Complainant, delivered from behind bySO#1, would appear a proportionate and commensurate use of force.  Though it likely resulted in some if not all of the Complainant’s injuries, the force with which the Complainant hit the ground was as much a result of the Complainant’s own momentum as it was the force applied bySO#1.Once on the ground, the Complainant resisted arrest by refusing to surrender his arms from underneath him, but was eventually handcuffed bySO#2.  No strikes of any kind were delivered by the officers; rather,SO#2, at times pushing down on the Complainant’s back with his arms to gain leverage, was able to exert his greater muscular power to wrest control of the Complainant’s arms.  Here too, though there is some prospect that this force bySO#2 caused or contributed to the Complainant’s injuries, I am unable to reasonably conclude it was more than was needed to place the Complainant in handcuffs given the Complainant’s resistance at the time.There is a suggestion in part of the evidence that the Complainant was kneed by one of the officers while on the ground.  There are a number of reasons why it would be unwise and unsafe to lend credence to this evidence.  But, even if true, I am not satisfied that the nature and extent of this purported force was unlawful in light of the evidence that the Complainant was resisting arrest and had yet to be handcuffed at the time.In the final analysis, as there is insufficient evidence to reasonably believe that eitherSO#2 orSO#1 comported himself other than lawfully throughout their interaction with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against either officer.

Whether the contact in question was inherently sexual is to be assessed objectively in view of the surrounding circumstances.  That is, would a reasonable person conclude that the conduct was sexual in character?  In the instant case, the issue is whether the contact that took part in the course of the search, including that which occurred with the Complainant’s private areas, was sexual in nature.  In my view, it was not.At the outset, there is no reason to question the validity of the Complainant’s arrest.  Officers, includingSO#2, had been dispatched to her parents’ home when they called police to report that the Complainant was at their residence in breach of a release condition that she abstain from alcohol.  As there is evidence that the Complainant was in fact drinking in violation of her bail,SO#2 was within her rights to take her into custody.Thereafter, I am satisfied that the officers, more specifically,SO#1, had a reasonable basis upon which to direct that the Complainant be subject to a strip search.  InR v Golden, [2001] 3 SCR 679, the Supreme Court of Canada observed that a strip search would only be appropriate where, in addition to a lawful arrest, there were reasonable and probable grounds to believe that such a search was necessary.  The Complainant was clearly intoxicated by alcohol at the time.  The information received from her parents and her own behaviour would have made that clear.  She also, however, acknowledged having consumed cocaine and marijuana.  In the circumstances, it would appear thatSO#1 had a legitimate concern that the Complainant might have contraband secreted on her person and that a search was necessary in the interests of her safety while in custody.I am also satisfied that the manner in which the search was conducted did not offend the dictates of Golden, supra. The search was ordered by a senior officer and was to be conducted by officers of the same gender as the Complainant in a private room.  It was only when the Complainant objected to the presence of multiple officers in and around the room, including most emphatically that ofSO#1, that she was removed from the room and searched in the booking area.  While it might be thatSO#1 acted with haste and might better have been advised to give the Complainant additional time to cooperate, the Complainant’s belligerence in words and gestures would have given the officer grounds to believe that the Complainant was not about to comply with the officers’ directions.  In the circumstances, it was open toSO#1 to reasonably conclude that a difficult search in the small and confined search room represented a health and safety risk to all involved, and that the better course was to move the search into the larger booking area.  For reasons also related to the Complainant’s belligerence, I am unable to fault the officers for bringing the Complainant to the ground to complete the search and using force to keep her movements controlled in light of her physical resistance.  In so doing, it should be noted that the officers did not forcibly remove all of the Complainant’s clothing such that she was completely naked at any given time.  Indeed, aside from the exposure of the Complainant’s buttocks, made necessary, in my view, if the officers were going to adequately search the area, the Complainant remained clothed throughout the process.  Lastly, it is apparent that the officers were not cavalier with the Complainant’s dignity as they pulled her pants down; efforts were made by the officers to lift her pants after a period of exposure, a blanket was requested (presumably, to be used to cover the Complainant) and the male officers turned away at points to afford the Complainant a measure of privacy.In the final analysis, while I have no doubt that the Complainant felt her sexual integrity violated by the search that occurred, I am for the foregoing reasons unable to reasonably conclude that the conduct of the officers was anything other than part-and-parcel of a legitimate law enforcement exercise.

In the case of lethal force, section 25(3) further provides that such force will not be justified unless the officer in question reasonably believed it was necessary for his or her self-preservation from death or grievous bodily harm.  I am unable to reasonably conclude on the evidence gathered by theSIUthat theSO’s shooting of the Complainant does not attract the protection of section 25.There is little doubt that theSOwas in the execution of his lawful duties when he confronted the Complainant on the northwest corner of Lake Shore Boulevard West and Twenty Fourth Street and sought to take him into custody.  The officer had good reason to believe that the male he saw approaching him with a hatchet was the same individual who had threatened persons in the area with a weapon and prompted multiple 911 calls.  The Complainant was clearly subject to arrest.I am further satisfied that theSOheld a genuine belief at the time he pulled the trigger of his C8 rifle that it was necessary to shoot the Complainant to protect himself from an imminent threat to life and limb.  While there is no direct evidence of the officer’s mindset to this effect, theSOhaving chosen not to provide a statement to theSIU, the circumstances surrounding the shooting strongly suggest such a conclusion.  Those same circumstances, outlined in some detail below, further establish the reasonableness of theSO’s belief.The hatchet brandished by the Complainant was clearly capable of inflicting grievous injury and death.  Moreover, there was no innocent explanation for the Complainant’s possession of the item.  To the contrary, it is apparent that the Complainant had threatened persons with the weapon prior to theSO’s arrival.  While theSOwould not have known the full scope of the Complainant’s behaviour prior to his arrival, the officer certainly would have quickly appreciated in the brief period before the shooting that the Complainant constituted a present danger to people around him.  That knowledge and the Complainant’s prior conduct lend credence to the existence of a real risk of violence that would have prevailed at the time of the shooting.TheSO’s use of a firearm was also a commensurate response to the jeopardy he was facing.  The officer had given the Complainant reasonable opportunity to drop the hatchet, even retreating a distance as the Complainant picked up his pace and advanced toward him.  Regrettably, though the Complainant initially threw the hatchet away, he picked it up shortly thereafter and moved toward theSOwith a level of resolve.  Might the officer have continued his retreat or withdrawn from the situation entirely?  Perhaps, but I am unable to conclude that the officer acted unreasonably in failing to do so.  They were in a public space with third parties in the area and the Complainant had already shown a willingness to use the hatchet to threaten others.  In the circumstances, disengagement would likely have placed persons in the vicinity at continuing risk.  Nor am I persuaded that there were other options short of lethal force available to theSOthat necessarily ought to have been used ahead of a resort to gunfire.  TheSOwas the only officer on scene at the time faced with an aggressive individual moving in his direction with a dangerous weapon.  While it is conceivable that lesser force, such as aCEW, might have been successful in thwarting the threat, I am unable to conclude that theSOacted out of proportion when he matched the Complainant’s hatchet with a lethal option of his own.  Finally, at a distance of about five metres from the officer and still advancing when the shot was fired, I am satisfied that theSOwas at imminent risk of being attacked with a hatchet when he shot the Complainant.For the foregoing reasons, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOacted without legal justification when he shot and injured the Complainant.  More specifically, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably believe that theSOshot the Complainant other than under a reasonable apprehension at the time that doing so was necessary to protect himself from death or grievous bodily harm.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against theSO.Date:	March 22, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1195

,,Chatham-Kent,Ontario,CW 1 was fortunate to have escaped serious injury,"The offences that arise for consideration aredangerous driving causing bodily harmandcriminal negligence causing bodily harm contraryto sections 320.13(2) and 221 of theCriminal Code, respectively.  The former is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  The latter is a more serious offence that is reserved for behaviour that demonstrates a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others. It is not made out unless there has been a markedandsubstantial departure from a reasonable level of care.  In the instant case, the pivotal issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which theSOpursed the pickup truck that was so egregious as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.Though theSO’s decision-making and conduct throughout the pursuit are subject to legitimate criticism, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officer transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  Certainly, theSOfell short in failing to advise his communications centre that he had initiated a pursuit and, thereafter, keeping the centre apprised of relevant circumstances surrounding the pursuit, such as direction of travel, speeds, environmental conditions, and other risk factors.  In so doing, he violated section 3 of O. Reg. 266/10, which is intended to ensure that a supervisor removed from the scene is in a position to make an informed and dispassionate decision with respect to whether the pursuit should continue.  If theSOhad kept his dispatcher abreast of the situation, the pursuit might well have been called off given the speeds that were reached andCW#1’s dangerous driving.On the question of speed, it is hard to justify the lengths to which theSOwent to keep pace withCW#1.  The GPS data establish that he travelled in a range around 160 km/h for much of the pursuit on Highway 401, topping out upwards of 170 for a brief period.  At those speeds, I am satisfied that theSOconstituted a danger on the roadway, particularly as he does not appear to have been operating his siren for most, if any, part of the pursuit.  TheSOseems to have believed that it was imperative to catch and stop the vehicle given fears that the Complainant had previously expressed to him about her well-being vis-à-visCW#1.  I accept that the officer harboured a real concern about the Complainant, and that the troubled history between she andCW#1, which had resulted in a recent non-association order, lent credence to that concern.  What is difficult to accept is that theSOfailed to appreciate the equally valid risks to the Complainant’s health and safety created by the continuation of a high-speed pursuit.  It ought to have been apparent to theSOthatCW#1 was not about to abandon his efforts to escape apprehension well before the collision at the Kent Bridge Road off-ramp, and that public safety was best served by discontinuing the pursuit.  And, yet, the officer persisted until the end.On the other side of the ledger, it bears noting that police officers engaged in the execution of their duties are exempt from speeding restrictions pursuant to section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act.  The provision was operative in this case as theSOhad seenCW#1 in breach of a court order and was therefore within his rights in wanting to stop the vehicle.  While the section does not confer carte-blanche on police officers to speed as they wish in spite of public safety considerations, it is a mitigating factor in the liability analysis.  This is particularly so in relation to the speeds reached by theSOprior to entering onto Highway 401 as one might reasonably expect an officer to exceed the speed limit in the initial stages of an engagement as they attempt to close the distance.  The fact that theSO’s emergency lights were on during the pursuit, traffic was light, and the weather was clear and dry, also served to mitigate the risks inherent in the officer’s speeds.Finally, aside from his speed and persistence, I am satisfied that theSOdid not directly imperil the safety of vehicular traffic around him or unduly fuelCW#1’s reckless driving.  For example, there is no evidence that third-party motorists were forced to take evasive action to avoid colliding with the officer’s cruiser.  And there is every indication thatCW#1 engaged in highly risky maneuvers on the road of his own volition.  Thus, though theSOwas at times right behind the pickup truck, it is apparent thatCW#1 was not prevented from altering his course of driving if he was so inclined.TheSOought to have discontinued the pursuit, in my view, given the balance of public safety considerations that prevailed for much of the engagement.  That he did not do so, coupled with his speeds and failure to provide any information to the police dispatcher about what he was doing, contributed, in my view, to a danger on the roadway.  Nevertheless, when weighed in the mix with the extenuating considerations, I am not reasonably satisfied that the officer’s shortcomings were such as to render theSO’s driving a marked departure from a reasonable standard of care in the circumstances, let alone a marked and substantial departure from that standard.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	August 30, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1531

,York Regional Police,Grey,Ontario,The Complainant was transported to hospital and diagnosed with multiple gunshot wounds,"Pursuant to section 34 of theCriminal Code, the use of force in the defence of oneself or another from a reasonably apprehended attack, actual or threatened, is legally justified provided the force in question was itself reasonable.  In assessing the reasonableness of the force, regard must be had to the relevant circumstances, including such considerations as the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon; and, the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force.  There is insufficient evidence, in my view, to reasonably conclude that the force used by any of the subject officers fell afoul of the limits prescribed by section 34.Starting from the very beginning, the officers who engaged the Complainant were in the lawful discharge of their duties.SO#3 had observed the Complainant traveling through a red light on Highway 7 in the area of Bathurst Street and was within his rights in seeking to stop him for a traffic infraction.  That intervention was cut short bySO#3, properly in my view, when the Complainant accelerated away westward on Highway 7.  By the timeSO#3 again caught up with him at the scene of the shooting, the Complainant had fired his gun several times in the direction of officers and was clearly subject to arrest.  He had done so knowing they were police officers and before any of them had drawn their own weapons, let alone fired them.  In the circumstances, the officers had cause to pursue the Complainant in order to take him into custody for serious crimes.I am also satisfied that the record falls short of reasonably establishing that any of the shots fired by the subject officers were unlawful.  With respect to the bulk of that gunfire consisting of two, six and three shots[2]discharged bySO#1,SO#4 andSO#2, respectively, in the portico, these followed an initial volley of rounds fired at the officers by the Complainant.  The officers were faced with an immediate threat to their lives and were entitled to meet that threat with a resort to lethal force of their own.  This remained the case notwithstanding the fact that most if not all of the police gunfire occurred after the Complainant’s first several shots had come to an end given the nature of the threat the officers were confronting – a weapon capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death in an instant and at long range, and in the hands of an individual whom they had every reason to believe would use it again.Indeed, the Complainant did use his gun again to fire in the direction ofSO#1,SO#4 andSO#2 seconds after emerging from the east end of the portico running across a parking lot toward the front of the Riviera Event Centre.  Once again, he was met by return gunfire fromSO#4, who was himself nearing the end of the portico.  As was the case mere seconds earlier, the officers’ lives hung in the balance and they responded, reasonably in my view, by attempting to neutralize the threat from a distance with the only weapons at their disposal capable of doing so – their firearms.  The same, I am satisfied, may be said of the exchange of gunfire that occurred between the Complainant andSO#4 along the east side of the Riviera Event Centre.  It appears that the officer fired a single round from his Glock at the Complainant in and around the same time that the Complainant, then running north toward the rear of the building, discharged his weapon once in the officer’s direction.The pattern repeated itself one last time as the Complainant rounded the northeast corner of the event centre and ran westward alongside the building.  While being chased bySO#3 andSO#5, the Complainant fired what would be the last round from his gun.  The officers reacted by firing their C8 rifles at the Complainant.  When they fired their weapons, the officers could not have known that the Complainant had emptied his firearm.  The Complainant had shown a propensity to fire at the officers while trying to make good his escape, and the officers would have had reason to believe he would continue to do so.  In the circumstances, I am again left to conclude thatSO#3 andSO#5 would have reasonably feared for their lives and the lives of other in the vicinity, including other officers, when they fired their C8s at the Complainant, even as one, and possible more, of those shots struck the Complainant as he was running away from the officers.  In arriving at this conclusion, it is telling to note that the Complainant, though he had emptied the magazine attached to his weapon, was subsequently found to be in the possession of an additional loaded magazine on his person.The issue arises whether the officers had other means available to defend themselves from the threat posed by the Complainant.  It may be, for example, that withdrawal or retreat from the scene would have sufficed to ensure their personal safety.  Withdrawal or retreat, however, were not realistic options.  The subject officers were police officers with a sworn duty to preserve and protect all life, not simply their own.  The Complainant was in possession of a firearm which he had fired multiple times at the officers. The public safety imperatives of the moment dictated the need for his immediate apprehension, particularly in light of the condominium building in the vicinity and its many residents.In the final analysis, as I am unable to reasonably conclude that any of the subject officers used force that was more than was necessary to defend against a real and present threat of grievous bodily harm or death at the hands of the Complainant, there is no basis to proceed with criminal charges in this case.

,Greater Sudbury Police Service,Armour,Ontario,The pathologist’s preliminary view at autopsy attributed Cst Hovingh’s death to shotgun wounds to his left thigh,"The law of self-defence in Canada is rooted in section 34 of theCriminal Code.  It legally justifies conduct intended to thwart a reasonably apprehended attack, both actual and threatened, if the conduct is itself reasonable in the circumstances.  Among the considerations bearing on the reasonableness of the conduct in question are the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; and, whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon.  In my view, the force used by Cst Hovingh, namely, the repeated discharge of his firearm at Mr. Brohman, fell squarely within the justification of section 34.When Cst Hovingh entered the trailer and was quickly confronted by Mr. Brohman, at a distance of some four to five metres away, firing a shotgun at him, he was entitled to resort to lethal force of his own.  The officer’s life was manifestly in jeopardy at the time, as his subsequent passing due to shotgun wounds to the leg confirmed.  And nothing short of a firearm would have provided the sort of rapid and immediately incapacitating effect that was imperative if Cst Hovingh was to have any chance of saving his life.  Withdrawal or disengagement was not an option largely because neither was available to Cst Hovingh.  The officer was caught by surprise as Mr. Brohman turned toward him with a shotgun and started to fire.  In the circumstances, it would appear that the officer had only split seconds to react, and may have even been wounded, by the time he drew his gun and started to fire back.Cst Hovingh’s gunfire was also a reasonable response in defence of the lives and safety of his partner,WO#1, and the civilian witnesses –CW#1 andCW#2 – all of whom were in the vicinity of the trailer when the shots rang out.  Faced with an armed individual shooting at him, Cst Hovingh could only have concluded that all of their lives were in imminent peril if Mr. Brohman was left unchecked and allowed to exit the trailer, particularly asWO#1 was in the area of the trailer door’s threshold when Mr. Brohman first fired.  Mr. Brohman must have known that his arrest was unavoidable and he acted as if he had nothing left to lose.  On this record, it is entirely conceivable that Cst Hovingh’s actions served to deter what could well have been a continuing risk to the lives and limbs of others around him.The issue of whether the officers were lawfully inside the trailer at the time of the shooting is one that need not be addressed.  In R v Feeney, [1997] 2 SCR 13, the Supreme Court of Canada held that police officers could generally not lawfully force their way  into a dwelling-house to effect an arrest in the absence of a warrant.[3]On the one hand, it is clear that Cst Hovingh andWO#1 forcibly entered a trailer where Mr. Brohman resided without judicial pre-authorization or the existence of exigent circumstances.  On the other hand, Mr. Brohman had set up his trailer unlawfully on land owned byCW#1; he was a trespasser on the property whom the officers had reason to believe was engaged in an illegal marijuana grow operation.  Be that as it may, Mr. Brohman was at no point entitled to use lethal force against the officers.  When he did so, whatever the officers’ status inside the trailer, they were entitled to defend themselves.[4]A final note is warranted about the aftermath of the shooting and, specifically, the length of time it took before police and then paramedics entered the trailer.  Though the shooting happened at about 11:00 a.m., it was not until about 12:30 p.m., with the arrival ofERTofficers, that police gained entry.  I am unable to fault the officers on scene for waiting forERTofficers.  WhileWO#1, initially, and then other arriving officers would have known that Cst Horvingh had been injured, no one was sure about the status of Mr. Brohman.  As far as they knew, he could easily have been lying in wait in the trailer still capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death.  In this regard, it is telling to note that post-incident forensic analysis of the scene led to the discovery of dozens of improvised explosives and incendiary materials on the property, and numerous firearms inside the trailer.  Moreover, a civilian witness, on hearing of the shooting, contacted police at about 3:30 p.m. to warn them of his concern that the property might be booby-trapped with pipe bombs and propane tank bombs.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the decision to wait to deploy anERTteam – with their specialized training and resources – was an entirely prudent one.In the result, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that Cst Hovingh conducted himself lawfully throughout his engagement with Mr. Brohman, justifiably resorting to lethal force that resulted in Mr. Brohman’s death at the same time as he too suffered mortal gunshot wounds.

The officer followed in the pickup truck’s direction of travel for a short period after it first came to a stop before setting off southward again on Highway 73, but quickly pulled his cruiser to the side of the road, came to a stop and turned off his emergency lights.  He only resumed his travel south when authorized to do so by the communications centre, several minutes later, and came upon the collision scene at the Highway 73 and Ron McNeil Line intersection.  There was no question of any excessive speed on the part of theSOat any time.In the result, as there is no evidence that theSOconducted himself other than lawfully throughout his brief engagement with the Complainant’s pickup truck, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	June 21, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1414

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,nCause of Death The pathologist at autopsy attributed the Complainant’s death to “multiple blunt impact trauma”,"The offence that arises for consideration is criminal negligence causing death contrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The crime captures behaviour that demonstrates a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of others.  Simple negligence is insufficient to ground liability; rather, what is required, in part, is conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which the subject officers approached the situation involving the Complainant that contributed to his death and was sufficiently egregious as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.A police officer’s foremost duty is the preservation of life.  The officers who responded to the Dundas Street overpass, includingSO#2 andSO#1, were acting in the discharge of that duty as they tried to prevent the Complainant from harming himself.There is nothing that would give cause for concern in the efforts of police officers prior to the arrival ofSO#2 andSO#1.  They spoke to the Complainant and impressed on him that they were there to help.  Warned by the Complainant not to get too close or he would jump, the officers maintained their distance and did what they could to de-escalate the situation.  When the Complainant expressed concern about the presence of a pedestrian on the pathway below him,WO#1 assured him that he would remove the person, and did so.  These efforts included the use of a TPSMCIT, which paired an officer specially trained in incidents involving persons in mental health crisis,WO#4, with a mental health professional,CW#3.In time, the TPSETFwas deployed to the scene.ETFofficers are trained to deal with life and death situations, such as the one at hand, with access to specialized resources to assist in their efforts.SO#2 andSO#1 took over the negotiations and tried various things to make progress with the Complainant.  These included having the Complainant’s sister and friends make voice recordings which were played for the Complainant, and bringing the Complainant’s dog out to the scene.  The services of a psychiatrist –CW#2 – were also enlisted.CW#2 arrived at the scene and even took a turn at personally speaking with the Complainant thinking the presence of a physician might make a difference.  In the meantime, the fire department was asked about any equipment they might have in their possession to protect the Complainant should he fall.  No such equipment was available.  As for a more proactive posture, more than one officer explained that rushing the Complainant was never a realistic option given the size of the railing that separated the Complainant from the roadway.  On this record, I am satisfied that theETF, andSO#2 andSO#1 in particular, comported themselves throughout with due regard for the life and safety of the Complainant.In the final analysis, though the police operation on the bridge was unable to prevent the Complainant tragically taking his own life, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any of the officers, includingSO#2 andSO#1, transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Before closing the file, I note for the record evidence suggesting thatWO#3 andWO#1 turned off their in-car camera systems at one point because they thought the Complainant was about to jump, and they did not want to video record that moment.  While one can appreciate the human impulse behind the officers’ decision, their conduct had the effect of depriving this office of potentially very relevant evidence.  These systems are in place, after all, to capture important events as they unfold.  I will be raising this matter in my reporting letter to the chief of police as conduct of this nature could have far-reaching consequences in other cases.Date:	May 17, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1364

The assessment of reasonableness is to be made on the basis of the circumstances that prevailed at the time, such as: the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force;  whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon; and, the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force.  In my view, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that the force used by theSOfell afoul of the limits of justifiable force prescribed by section 34.At the outset, it is important to note that theSOwas lawfully placed and engaged in the execution of his duties when he first confronted the Complainant.  He had seen one of the males inside the Nissan running from the residence at which the reported break and enter had just occurred.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that theSO’s suspicions that the occupants of the Nissan were implicated in the break and enter were based on reasonable rounds, thereby authorizing the Complainant’s detention for purposes of investigation:R. v. Mann,  [2004] 3SCR59.Thereafter, the officers were entitled to resort to a measure of force to protect themselves when the Complainant physically contested his detention and produced a handgun, and I am satisfied they did so within the confines of the law.  By the time the Complainant retrieved his gun, he and the officers had been immersed in a short but vigorous physical struggle.[2]It was clear that he had no intention of submitting to the officers if he could help it.  Against this backdrop,WO#2 and theSOcould only surmise, as I am confident they did, that their lives were at imminent risk when two rounds were discharged from the Complainant’s firearm, at least one of which was aimed in their general direction.  At the sight of the gun,WO#2 scrambled for cover between the pickup truck and theSO’s cruiser, parked behind the Nissan, and was fortunate not to have been struck by a bullet.  TheSO, who did the same, quickly returned fire at the Complainant.  He discharged two rounds, one of which entered the Complainant’s lower back and promptly incapacitated him. On this record, I am unable to fault theSOfor meeting what was clearly a lethal threat with lethal force of his own.  Lesser force, such as aCEWdischarge, was unlikely to be successful as the Complainant was wearing a winter jacket.  Moreover, the circumstances did not permit of simple containment from a position of cover given the proximity of the parties and the necessity in the moment to quickly denude the Complainant of his ability to discharge the firearm, which he still had hold of when he was shot.  Nor does the fact that the Complainant was wounded in the back strip the shooting of legal justification.  This was not the case of an individual clearly more interested in fleeing police than causing grievous bodily harm or death.  Rather, two rounds had just been fired from the Complainant’s weapon when theSOdischarged his weapon.  In light of the dynamism of the moment, and accounting for the lag inherent in reaction times, the evidence does not reasonably establish that the Complainant was anything less than a clear and present danger to the lives ofWO#2 and theSOwhen he was shot.For the foregoing reasons, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOacted unlawfully when he discharged his firearm at the Complainant.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	June 21, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1416

,Kingston Police,Kingston,Ontario,The Complainant was extricated from the wreckage and taken to\xa0KGH\xa0where she was diagnosed with fractures of her left arm and right shoulder,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances. In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which theSOcomported himself during his engagement with the Complainant that was sufficiently derelict as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas within his rights in initiating a pursuit of the Complainant’s motor vehicle as it sped past him on Highway 401 and then refused the officer’s direction to pull over.  There is evidence that the Complainant was traveling significantly over the speed limit and was subject to being stopped and ticketed.  But speed was not the only issue.  The officer had also seen the Complainant driving on the passing lane shoulder and almost striking the concrete barrier.  There were grounds, in the circumstances, to believe the Complainant was driving dangerously and/or under the influence.Thereafter, I am satisfied that the pursuit was conducted without undue risk to the public.  TheSOdid travel at over 160 km/h on Highway 401, but he did so over a brief period of time attempting to catch up to the Complainant’s speeding Honda.  With respect to theSO’s speed, it should also be noted that section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Actexempts officers engaged in the performance of their duty from the speed law.  While the provision does not confer on officers free rein to speed as they wish, it is important to note that the highway would have had no more than modest traffic given the time of day and theSO’s use of his emergency equipment, both of which would have mitigated the dangers associated with his excessive albeit brief spurt of speed.  The same may be said of theSO’s acceleration northward on Highway 15  - in the area of 150 km/h - as he again attempted to close ground on the Honda.Once on Highway 15, the only conduct of any real concern is with the decision to attempt a tandem stop of the Complainant’s vehicle.  The technique involves the use of police cruisers to surround and eventually stop a subject vehicle via controlled deceleration.  Though officers are trained in the technique, and provision is made for its use in police policies governing pursuits, it is a risky maneuver given the potential for vehicle-to-vehicle contact and should be reserved for situations where it is imperative that a vehicle be stopped.  By the time the officers decided to tandem stop the Honda, the Complainant had given every indication of being a serious danger on the roadway.  Having seen her speed and erratic driving on Highway 401, theSOhad by now also observed her vehicle stopped in the middle of a roadway – Innovation Drive - for no apparent reason.  On this record, there was an articulable and pressing reason to stop the Complainant.  Moreover, it is important to note that all three vehicles were travelling at modest speeds as the officers surrounded the Complainant’s car and began to slow down.  It is true that the Complainant’s Honda struck theSO’s cruiser, but the impact was minor and in part due to the apparent result of a miscalculation on the part of the officer in the lead cruiser,WO#1, who had left too big a gap between his rear and the Honda’s front as the convoy was coming to a stop. In the circumstances, I am unable to conclude that the decision to attempt a tandem stop, and thereafter its attempted execution by the officers, were unreasonable.Finally, it bears noting that the roadways were dry and the weather was clear, albeit visibility would have been compromised given the late hour; there is no indication of any third-party traffic being directly placed in harm’s way by theSOat any point; and, the officer kept his communication centre apprised of what was going on, allowing a senior official to properly monitor and direct the course of the pursuit.  While it might have been preferable for theSOto explicitly seek further approval from the official prior to resuming his pursuit of the Honda on Highway 15, the officer having been ordered to discontinue moments prior, the cumulative impact of these considerations was not such as to render theSO’s conduct clearly prohibitive on public safety grounds.In the final analysis, as I am satisfied that theSOdid not at any time transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law during his engagement with the Complainant’s Honda, there is no basis for proceeding with charges against the officer and the file is closed.Date:	February 1, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1077
,Toronto Police Service,Grey,Ontario,The driver of the Hyundai and his wife the Complainant and CW 3 were sent to hospital where only the Complainant was diagnosed with a serious injury – a fractured sternum,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in which the subject officers operated their vehicles that caused or contributed to the collision and/or was sufficiently derelict as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.The officers who took part in the operation to surveille the Honda from a distance and, in the penultimate stages of the incident, to apprehend and pursue it, were engaged in the lawful discharge of their duties.  The officers had reasonable cause to believe that the vehicle’s occupants had been involved in at least three separate robberies of pharmacies in the Scarborough area of Toronto, and that the use of weapons had been threatened in those incidents.  In the circumstances, there were grounds to believe that the Honda’s occupants were subject to arrest and that considerations of public safety dictated their prompt apprehension.In the course of the half-hour or so that preceded the takedown attempt at Bur Oak Avenue, there is no indication in the evidence of any marked deviation in the manner in which the police vehicles involved in the operation were being handled, including those ofSO#2 andSO#1.  As far as can be ascertained, the speeds and driving behaviour of the officers appear at all times to have been in substantial compliance with the rules of the road and there is no indication of any third-parties or, indeed, the Honda occupants, having been put at risk.With respect to the takedown that was called byWO#2, I am unable to conclude that the decision to engage the tactic, or its subsequent execution, was unreasonable.  Until this point,WO#2 had very purposefully, and, sensibly, in my view, directed the involved officers to keep their distance from the Honda and to not pursue it.  They were on highly trafficked roadways for most of that engagement and had no need to aggressively follow it given the officers’ access to the Honda’s directionality via GPS data.  It was only when the Honda found itself stopped at a red light on Bur Oak Avenue with little to no traffic on it at the time that the takedown was called.  Once that occurred, there is no suggestion that eitherSO#2 orSO#1 were negligent or reckless in how they approached their tasks.  They quickly positioned their cruisers in front of and behind the Honda, and exited their cruisers in an effort to effect a gunpoint arrest of the vehicle’s occupants.  Regrettably, perhaps given the size of the Pilot and the fact that the officers were unable to block its passenger side because of what appears to have been construction on the roadway, the vehicle was able to ram its way free.Thereafter, in the course of a very brief flight from police through the hospital grounds and then south on Ninth Line, there is again little to no evidence of any police cruiser having endangered public safety by way of its speed or other driving behaviour.  In fact, it appears the officers who did chase after the Honda kept their distance atWO#2’s direction and were a fair distance away from the Honda when it turned onto Highway 7 and crashed into the Complainant’s vehicle.  In the circumstances, it cannot be said that the Honda driver was unduly pushed or prevented from altering his reckless course by an overly aggressive police presence behind him, nor is it the case that the officers were without grounds to continue their chase after the Honda.  To reiterate, its occupants were being pursued for very serious crimes of violence that had just occurred.In the result, as I am satisfied that neither of the subject officers or any of the involved officers transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law throughout the course of this incident, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case notwithstanding the collision that marked its termination.

The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that deviates markedly from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  There is nothing in the evidence, in my view, to suggest that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.The officers were within their rights to initiate a pursuit on Peninsula Road.  Given what they had been told of the 911 call, they had good cause to believe that the truck they encountered contained the Complainant, who had reportedly committed a serious criminal offence.Thereafter, there is little to no evidence that theSOendangered the lives of anyone as he briefly pursued the pickup truck.  While the officer did reach speeds upwards of 150 km/h, he did so over an engagement that was brief in time and distance (about one minute and 1.7 kilometres), with emergency lights and siren on, and at a time when there would have been little to no traffic on the road.  Notwithstanding his speed, theSOwas unable to gain any ground on the pickup truck and, wisely in my opinion, terminated the pursuit soon after it had begun about two kilometres from the collision scene.  Regrettably, instead of following suit and reducing his speed, the driver of the pickup truck continued his reckless course and crashed the vehicle on Camp 19 Road north of Highway 17.As I am unable to reasonably conclude on the foregoing record that the manner in which theSOoperated the police cruiser in the moments before the collision fell afoul of the criminal law, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case against the officer.

First, was the force used by the officer against the Complainant lawful?  Second, did the care exercised by theSOas he engaged the Complainant and tried to save him harmless from the perils of highway traffic fall within the limits of the criminal law?  In my view, the answer to both questions is in the affirmative.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  The Complainant gave every indication of being of unsound mind at the time and at risk of doing himself harm.  He was walking along the shoulder of the highway for no apparent reason and confronted the officer aggressively when asked if he was okay.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that theSOwas proceeding to lawfully apprehend the Complainant under section 17 of theMental Health Act.Thereafter, I am satisfied that the officer acted reasonably in attempting to take the Complainant into custody.  The two wrestled by the side of the road, neither getting the upper hand, after the officer took hold of the Complainant.  No strikes were thrown by the officer, though there is evidence of the Complainant throwing a punch or two at the officer.The subsequent use of theCEWby theSOwas, in my view, commensurate with the exigencies at hand.  As the Complainant was dangerously close to the live lanes of traffic, the officer could not risk physically engaging him once again without endangering both of their lives. What was needed was a means by which the Complainant could be immediately incapacitated from a distance.  TheCEWfit that bill and appeared to work if only, regrettably, for a period.  Within seconds, one of the probes dislodged, whereupon the Complainant was able to regain his strength and run headlong into the eastbound lanes.At this point there was very little theSOcould do other than what he did – track the Complainant’s path of travel from the shoulder while shouting at him to remove himself from the roadway.  When traffic finally cleared sufficiently to allow theSOto cross, he did so; by this time, however, it was too late.  The Complainant had fallen through the gap between the concrete barriers to the ground below.  On this record, there is no question of any criminal negligence on the part of the officer that can be said to have contributed to the Complainant’s injuries.For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied that theSOconducted himself lawfully throughout his engagement with the Complainant – in the force he used attempting to apprehend the Complainant and the care he exercised endeavouring to keep him safe from the live lanes of traffic on Highway 8.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	March 22, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1193

,Hamilton Police Service,Guelph,Ontario,He was taken to hospital and diagnosed with a fracture to the right little finger,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that departs markedly from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether theSOdisplayed a want of care in the manner in which he engaged with the Complainant which caused or contributed to the collision and/or was sufficiently egregious as to attract criminal sanction. In my view, though there are aspects of theSO’s conduct that were problematic, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the officer transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.It appears that theSOpushed the limits and perhaps even violated one or more of the strictures set out in O. Reg. 266/10, the provincial regulation that governs police pursuits.  For starters, there is little question that theSOinitiated a suspect apprehension pursuit under the regulation that governs police pursuits in the province – O. Reg. 266/10.  He was within a couple of car lengths of the motorcycle, lights and siren on, as the Complainant continued southbound on Rosslyn Avenue North.  Thereafter, he was arguably precluded from initiating or continuing a pursuit under the terms of the regulation as he was aware of the licence plate marker on the motorcycle at an early point, that information having been provided over the radio from witnesses to the earlier collision.  For example, section 2(6) of O. Reg. 266/10 provides that “[a] police officer engaging in a suspect apprehension pursuit for a non-criminal offence shall discontinue the pursuit once the fleeing motor vehicle or an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle is identified”.  It must also be noted that theSOwas pursuing a motorcyclist who was in a relatively vulnerable position compared to the officer given the nature of their vehicles.  While the regulation does not outright ban the pursuit of motorcyclists, its fundamental organizing principal is that pursuits must not be undertaken where the dangers created by a pursuit to public safety outweigh the dangers to public safety of a fleeing vehicle left unchecked or unidentified.  Moreover, the police service’s pursuit policy lists a motorcycle as a risk factor to be considered in the assessment of public safety.  Given the nature of the predicate offence giving rise to the pursuit, the type of vehicle being pursued, and the fact that theSOwas following the motorcycle within inches of its rear wheel, one might reasonably infer that the balance of public safety considerations weighed against the course the officer adopted.  Finally, there was the attempted roadblock by theSO.  In my view, the tactic, though justified by the officer on the basis of preventing a pursuit from materializing on Barton Street, a couple of blocks south of their position, was ill-advised.  There was simply no imperative, in my view, to force an immediate end to the pursuit by way of such an inherently risky tactic in view of the prevailing circumstances at the time.On the other side of the ledger, there were a number of extenuating considerations in the circumstances that characterized the pursuit.  TheSO’s emergency lights and siren were on at all material times, thereby giving pedestrians and motorists in the vicinity some advance warning of the pursuit.  That said, whatever traffic was on the roadway in course of the pursuit was little to non-existent.  While I am troubled by the fact that theSOappears to have been within a metre or two of the motorcyclist at points as they travelled south on Rosslyn Avenue North, it bears noting that the vehicles’ speeds were fairly moderate at the time – not much more than 50 km/h as they approached Craigmiller Avenue.  As for the use of his cruiser to set up a roadblock on the road, it is apparent that theSOleft the Complainant sufficient time and space to come to a safe stop if he had been so inclined.  Finally, and importantly, the active pursuit portion of the officer’s overall engagement with the Complainant was exceedingly short – no more than 130 to 140 metres from the moment theSOactivated his lights and siren at the north end of Rosslyn Avenue North to the street’s intersection with Craigmiller Avenue.  Thus, whatever danger theSOwas creating was momentary.In the final analysis, when the pros and cons of theSO’s conduct are weighed in the balance, I am not persuaded with any degree of confidence that the officer’s shortcomings were such as to render his driving a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.

,London Police Service,Grey,Ontario,CW 1 remained inside the vehicle and was fortunate to have emerged without serious injury,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care on the part of theSOthat contributed to the collision and/or was sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas engaged in the lawful discharge of his duties when he took part in an attempt to box-in the GMC Sierra and then initiated a pursuit with the intention of stopping it.  He had reason to believe that the vehicle’s occupants had just engaged in a theft in the course of which they had threatened persons in the area with weapons. Officers responding to the 911 call had also received information that the pickup truck involved in the incident was also associated with an armed robbery earlier that day at anLCBOin Strathroy.The box-in of the Sierra seems to have been a reasonable tactic in the circumstances.  Given the gravity of the crimes the vehicle’s occupants were suspected to have committed, and their brazen nature, concerns that the Sierra would attempt to flee police apprehension were well-founded.  In the circumstances, theSOandWO#1 were entitled to preempt that contingency by physically blocking its ability to travel with their cruisers.  They did so in a reasonable fashion - at an intersection where the Sierra, its occupants seemingly unaware of the cruisers behind them, had come to a stop, and there was little if any pedestrian and vehicular traffic.Thereafter, as the Sierra broke free of the police roadblock, I am satisfied that theSOcomported himself with due care for public safety as he activated his emergency equipment and pursued the vehicle.  Though the officer exceeded the speed limit, he did so with few exceptions in moderate degree and without any evidence to suggest that traffic around him was at any time placed at risk.  The roads were dry, the weather was clear, and the officer’s emergency equipment was on as he made his way onto Exeter Road and, then, White Oak Drive, factors that would have tempered any danger associated with theSO’s speed.  Finally, though it appears that theSOdid not actually bring his cruiser to a stop upon being directed to discontinue the pursuit byWO#2, in fact continuing to travel above the 80 km/h speed limit on White Oak Drive until his arrival at the site of the collision, the evidence establishes that he was well back of the Sierra as it approached the bend in the road and crashed.In the final analysis, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO, in the course of an active engagement with the GMC Sierra over about 1.5 kilometres, transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

,Ottawa Police Service,Grey,Ontario,The injuries to the internal organs were a function of both blunt impact with the ground and acute deceleration forces,"At the outset of the liability analysis, it bears noting that there is no evidence of any direct, physical force having been brought to bear by any of the tactical officers against the Complainant.  I have no reason to discount the evidence of the officers inside the apartment, backed up by the observations and contemporaneous utterances ofWO#7 captured on police communication recordings, that the Complainant left his apartment via a bedroom window within seconds of the officers’ entry into the unit and before any of them had reached his room, which, incidentally, was the furthest from the front door.The offence that arises for consideration, in my view, iscriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is reserved for serious cases of neglect that demonstrate a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  Simply negligence is not enough to give rise to liability.  Rather, what is required, in part, is conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which the police operation was devised and executed that played a role in the Complainant’s death and was sufficiently egregious as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.I am satisfied that the tactical officers had lawful grounds to enter and search the apartment.  The day before, on October 6, 2020, the drug unit had secured a warrant authorizing a search of the apartment for firearms, drugs and drug paraphernalia.  The warrant was in effect at the time of the events in question.Though subject to legitimate scrutiny in part, I am further satisfied that the plan developed to enter the apartment and the manner of its execution did not transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  The morning of the raid, the tactical officers were apprised of the search warrant in effect and briefed on the objectives of the operation by the drug unit.  They were advised of the Complainant’s January 2020 arrest on drug and weapons charges, that information had been gathered indicating the Complainant was continuing to deal in drugs and was in possession of a handgun, and that he was to be arrested in the apartment.  Consideration was given to the manner of entry.  One of the options was a “breach and call-out” whereby the front door was forced upon and occupants called out one by one by officers from a position of safety.  The other alternative was a “dynamic entry”, in which officers would storm the unit using the element of surprise and an overwhelming show of force to disorient the occupants and neutralize any potential threats before they materialized.  The latter was decided by the incident commander,WO#8, for a variety of reasons, including the presence of third-party tenants on the floor and the risk of casualties or a barricaded person situation developing should a person in the apartment decide to arm themselves in a “breach and call-out” scenario.  There were risks inherent in both approaches, in my view, particularly as the Complainant was on firearms-related charges and police had cause to believe he was still armed, and I am unable to reasonably conclude that the choice to go with a dynamic entry was without merit.In arriving at this conclusion, I am mindful that dynamic entries have been the subject of public criticism and judicial censure.  InR. v. Bahlawan, 2020 ONSC 952, for example, the court chastised the choice by OPS tactical officers in that case to execute a search warrant by way of dynamic entry.  The rule, the court noted, was that police were to knock and announce their presence before entering a home with a search warrant.  A departure from the rule would only be countenanced where justified on the basis of exceptional circumstances, such as where there existed reasonable grounds to be concerned about the risk of harm to officers or occupants, or the destruction of evidence.  InBahlawan, supra, the tactical officers had proceeded with a dynamic entry based on accepted practice without considering why the knock-and-announce approach was inappropriate and, in doing so, had violated the accused’s right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure.The same cannot be said of the dynamic entry that occurred in this case.  The officers very expressly adverted to proceeding with a different manner of entry, namely, the “breach and call-out”, and decided, whether rightly or wrongly, that a dynamic entry was the better option.  Moreover, unlike the circumstances inBahlawan, supra, the police had an objectively articulable basis to be concerned about the presence of a firearms in the residence.  To reiterate, the Complainant was at the time facing firearms-related charges and the police had information to the effect that he was presently in possession of a handgun.It is of concern that the tactical officers did not appear to pay sufficient heed to the possibility that the subject of the search warrant – the Complainant – might attempt to flee apprehension via a descent from the building.  And yet, I am satisfied, that is precisely what occurred.[1]A number of officers expressed the view that the possibility was a remote one given the height of the apartment in question on the 12th floor.  However, recent high-profile and not as high-profile cases investigated by this office indicate that the possibility materializes from time-to-time in these types of police operations.  In my view, the officers ought to have turned their attention to this contingency and made some provision for it.[2]It might have been wise, for example, to establish a very visible police presence below the Complainant’s 12th floor apartment to deter any rash action motivated by a desire to escape.  That said, it must be recognized that one of the benefits of a dynamic entry is the speed with which the officers are able to establish control over a scene, foreclosing in at least some cases, presumably, conduct such as occurred in this case.In the result, while I accept that the impetus for the Complainant’s decision to jump from his window was a desire to escape apprehension at the hands of the officers entering his apartment, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the involved officers, including the three subject officers, contributed to the Complainant’s death by way of criminal negligence.  Though there may have been shortcomings in the operation that saw officers enter the Complainant’s apartment by way of dynamic entry, any such deficiencies fell short of rendering the officers’ conduct a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable level of care.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	August 30, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1529

The former is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  The latter is a more serious offence reserved for negligence that demonstrates a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.  It is not made out, inter alia, unless the impugned conduct constitutes a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable level of care.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care on the part of the police that caused or contributed to the collision and/or was sufficiently egregious as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.For starters, there is no suggestion in the evidence that the officers involved in Complainant #1’s arrest lacked the grounds to take him into custody.  Indeed, there was a warrant in effect under theControlled Drugs and Substances Actauthorizing the search of Complainant #1’s vehicle.The plan that was devised to take Complainant #1 into custody also seems to have been reasonable.  Wishing to avoid the perils of a possible pursuit, the objective was to track Complainant #1 and arrest him before he entered his vehicle.Though the operation did not materialize according to plan, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officers failed to comport themselves with due care and regard for public safety, including Complainant #1’s health and well-being.  WhenWO#1 and the undesignated officer approached Complainant #1 intending to arrest him, despite the fact that he was in his vehicle, they did so for an understandable reason.  According toWO#1, Complainant #1 had made eye contact with him as their vehicle crossed paths on Winona Drive, the suggestion being that the officers’ cover was blown.  In the circumstances, the decision to improvise on the fly in the hope that Complainant #1 might be arrested before he fled the scene in his vehicle was not without merit.  Thereafter, aside from a seconds’ long attempt byWO#2 andWO#8 to keep pace with the Mercedes Benz, quickly terminated byWO#7, there is no evidence of any further active engagement by any of the officers in the course of events that culminated in the collision.  Complainant #1 had ample opportunity to alter his reckless course and he chose not to.  On this record, I am satisfied that he alone is responsible for the collision at the intersection of Oakwood Avenue and Bude Street.For the foregoing reasons, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the officers involved in the operation that ultimately resulted in Complainant #1’s arrest transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care on the part of theSOthat caused or contributed to the Complainant’s injury and was sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.TheSOandWOwere on patrol in the lawful performance of their duties when they came across the Complainant on his motorcycle.  I accept theWO’s evidence that they decided to stop the Complainant after they had seen him having trouble operating his motorcycle as he turned onto Raymond Street.  In the circumstances, the officers were within their rights in seeking to investigate the Complainant to ensure he was a competent driver and that his motorcycle was in safe working order.Regrettably, instead of stopping for the police when he saw the cruiser’s emergency lights come on, the Complainant, knowing that he was unlicenced, accelerated in a short-lived effort to get away.  He quickly slowed to stop for the police, lost control of the motorcycle and fell to the ground.  By all accounts, the pursuit, such as it was, travelled some 300 metres in no more than about 26 seconds.  During that brief interval, both vehicles travelled at moderate average speeds, there was no indication of any third-parties in the vicinity having been placed at risk, and theSOremained well-back of the motorcycle.On the aforementioned-record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  Whether he ought to have discontinued the pursuit some time in advance of the collision given the inherent risks associated with chasing a motorcycle, the brevity and nature of the pursuit rendered any such indiscretion, if it was such, something less than a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care.Date:	March 15, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1191

Liability for the offence is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his vehicle that was sufficiently remiss to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.By the time theSOpicked up the pursuit of Complainant #2’sSUVeastbound on London Road, he had seen the vehicle speeding, driving the wrong way and disregarding red lights.  In the circumstances, there were grounds to believe that Complainant #2 had committed the criminal offence of dangerous driving.[1]Under O. Reg. 266/10, police officers are entitled to initiate a pursuit where they have reason to believe a criminal offence has been committed provided the balance of public safety considerations are not prohibitive.  I am satisfied that theSOwas in compliance with the regulation.The question arises whether theSO, having previously been directed by a senior officer to terminate the pursuit, ought to have obtained explicit permission to resume the chase.  Perhaps, but I am unable to hold his failure to do so against him to any large degree.  Several minutes had elapsed from the end of the first pursuit and the officer was now in an empty parking lot when he re-engaged with theSUVbefore it turned onto London Road.  Given the hour of day, there was very little vehicular and pedestrian traffic on the roadways to suggest public safety was at any significant risk.  Moreover, senior officers were apprised over the radio of what theSOandWO#2 were doing but issued no direction that the officers desist.There is also nothing in the evidence to suggest that theSOoperated his cruiser without due care and regard for public safety.  While his speeds exceeded the speed limit, rising as high as an average speed upwards of 100 km/h over two kilometres on Wellington Street, there is no indication of any users of the roadway being directly imperiled by the cruiser’s speed.  Nor is there any affirmative evidence, but for one occasion at the intersection of Talfourd Street and Lansdowne Avenue, that theSOfailed to stop at a red light or a stop sign.  The use by the officer of his emergency equipment throughout the pursuit and the favourable environmental conditions at the time – the weather was clear, traffic was light, and the roadways were dry and  in good repair – further tempered the inherent dangers associated with a speeding cruiser.Finally, it is important to note that theSOwas well back of Complainant #2’sSUVin time and distance as the vehicles sped westward on Talfourd Street toward Indian Road South.  That is to say, it was not the case that the officer unduly pushed Complainant #2 or otherwise prevented him from bringing his vehicle to a stop at the stop sign before he entered the intersection and caused the collision.  In fact, it remains unclear whether Complainant #2 even knew he was being followed by police cruisers at any point.On the aforementioned-record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the manner of theSO’s driving in the course of his pursuit of theSUVwas substandard or, that if it was in any respect, that it deviated markedly from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  Accordingly, there is no basis to proceed with criminal charges against the officer.Date:	March 15, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1189
,Ontario Provincial Police,Georgian Bay,Ontario,n\nCause of Death nThe pathologist at autopsy attributed the Complainant’s death to blunt force trauma to the head,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing deathcontrary to section 320.13(3) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances:R. v. Roy(2012), 281 CCC (3d) 433 (SCC);R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49.  While close to the line, I am satisfied that the evidence falls short of reasonably establishing that theSO’s conduct transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.The environmental conditions at the time of the incident were poor and called for extra caution from motorists.  The late hour and heavy rain in the area combined to significantly reduce visibility on the roadway.  Despite this,GPSdata associated with theSO’s cruiser established that she was traveling in excess of the speed limit as she approached the intersection – as high as 98 km/h in an 80 km/h zone two kilometres west of Jones Road and 89 km/h in a 60 km/h zone about 170 metres from the intersection.  While police officers in their police vehicles engaged in the lawful performance of their duties may exceed the speed limit pursuant to section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act, the officer was not responding to any call for service at the time and there was simply no need to drive as quickly as she was.  TheSO’s failure to slow her speed, in my view, compromised her ability to react to events in front of her given the prevailing weather and figured prominently in her failure to take note of the Complainant on the roadway.Beyond that, there is evidence that theSO’s full attention was not on the roadway ahead of her.  She says that she was distracted to an extent by another pedestrian crossing the road in the area of the intersection just before she struck the Complainant, and suggests the pedestrian in question wasCW#3.  However, there is contrary evidence indicating thatCW#3 was behind and to the west of the Complainant at the time of the collision, and not in the intersection, as theSOasserts.  I am unable to resolve this conflict in the evidence.  However, I would note that theSO’s evidence, even if accepted, would not absolve her of some level of responsibility for the collision.  Particularly in light of the weather conditions, her full focus ought to have been on the roadway in her path and not off to the side, as she suggests was the case.Notwithstanding the officer’s indiscretions, there are enough extenuating considerations such as to render theSO’s driving something less than a marked departure from a reasonable level of care.  The speeds, while high, were not significantly above the speed limits.  Moreover, the evidence indicates that the officer’s vehicle slowed as it approached Jones Road: 79 km/h in a 60 km/h zone about 70 metres from the collision site and 76 km/h some 25 metres from the point of impact.  The fact that the Complainant had a black garbage bag draped over his body as protection from the rain and was crossing against a red light must also be taken into account.  Not only is it reasonable to infer that theSOwould not have been expecting to see a pedestrian in her path, seeing the Complainant would have been made more difficult given his dark clothing.In the final analysis, while there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSO, particularly with respect to her speed in bad weather and lighting conditions, operated her cruiser in a dangerous fashion, I am not satisfied that the officer’s transgressions on balance rose to the level of criminal conduct.  Accordingly, there is no basis to proceed with criminal charges in this case.Date:	December 14, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1017

,,Durham,Ontario,The Complainant was ejected landed on his left side and sustained a fractured left scapula and four fractured left ribs,"Before any further consideration of whether the officers’ actions amounted to the crime ofdangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13 (2) of theCriminal Code, it is useful to consider what grounds theSOandWO#1 had for stopping the Complainant. TheSOandWO#1 could have stopped the Complainant either for driving anATVon a highway, contrary to section 191.8 (1) of theHighway Traffic Act, or for driving a motor vehicle on a highway without a number plate, contrary to section 7 (1) (b) of theHighway Traffic Act. A case can also be made that the Complainant, by driving in the centre of the roadway at night, was engaging in careless driving contrary to section 130 (1) of theHighway Traffic Act. For this reason, I am satisfied that the vehicle stop was lawful.Even a lawful stop by police, however, can become associated with unlawful behaviour – such as dangerous operation of a conveyance causing bodily harm. Such a situation, however, cannot be said to have arisen here. Neither police officer, when interacting with the Complainant, drove above any speed limits, engaged in any pursuit of the Complainant, or created a blockade with their police car into which the Complainant had no choice but to collide. Rather, both police officers were very careful to align their vehicles so that the Complainant could go around their vehicles. The Complainant chose to do this rather than stop, and, in doing so, crashed.For these reasons, there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	December 21, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1019
,London Police Service,London,Ontario,WO 2 went to the scene of the fall in order to help the Complainant who was eventually taken to the LHSC and diagnosed with pelvic fractures,"WO#1 andWO#2 were assigned to the Complainant’s call at 11:29 a.m.  At 11:34 a.m., they attended the apartment and were permitted by a tearful Complainant (whose sobs they had heard from outside his apartment) to enter his apartment. The officers were also aware that there was an outstanding warrant forCW#3’s arrest at the time.  OnceWO#1 andWO#2 arrestedCW#3, the Complainant broke down crying, because he had reconciled withCW#3, did not wantCW#3 to be arrested, and had thought that the police would give him a chance to explain this change in circumstances.Before the police officers left the Complainant,WO#2 asked the Complainant if he was all right, to which the Complainant replied that he was. Once the police officers were gone, however, the Complainant, tried to kill himself by falling from his balcony.WhenWO#1 andWO#2 learned that a man had fallen in the apartment building which they were leadingCW#3 out of,WO#1 was left to maintain custody overCW#3 whileWO#2, accompanied byWO#3, went to the scene of the fall and helped the Complainant until medical care arrived.As the preceding narrative reveals, the police officers were in no way physically responsible for the Complainant’s falling. As far as the officers’ potential criminal liability is concerned, therefore, the issue turns to whether there was a failure to act on the part of the police that caused or contributed to the Complainant’s injuries and, if so, whether those failures attract criminal sanction.The offence that arises for consideration iscriminal negligence causing bodily harmcontrary to section 221 of theCriminal Code.  This offence is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the standard of care which a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In my view, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that the officers who attended at the Complainant’s apartment to arrestCW#3 transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.The police officers were not present when the Complainant decided to jump from his balcony, nor were they neglectful in failing to take measures to prevent the Complainant from attempting to harm himself.  Rather,WO#2 inquired with the Complainant about whether the Complainant was all right, and only left the Complainant alone once the Complainant had assured him that he was all right. If eitherWO#1 orWO#2 had done research into the Complainant, they would have found no references to his being suicidal or having a history of mental illness.  It might be argued that the Complainant ought to have been apprehended for his own protection under section 17 of theMental Health Act.  That provision, however, requires that the person being arrested display signs of being a harm to self or others or being severely incapable of independent living. The Complainant’s crying in response toCW#3’s arrest does not fulfill these criteria, especially when juxtaposed with his statement toWO#2 that he was fine.  Simply put, the officers had no reason to suspect that the Complainant, upset though he was, presented a foreseeable risk of harm to himself or others, and therefore no reason to exercise any heightened caution in relation to his well-being.For the foregoing reasons, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	January 4, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1033
,Hamilton Police Service,Grey,Ontario,Following his arrest the Complainant was taken to the HGH for a cut over his left eye and was treated for fractures in his left foot,"Before any further analysis of the legal issues in this case, it must be noted that there is an issue related to causation in this case. Given the fact that the Complainant had been seated, without a seatbelt, in a BMW which was being deliberately rammed into other vehicles, the possibility arises that all of the Complainant’s serious injuries were caused during the BMW’s ramming maneuvers. Such a conclusion, however, need not be explored further because this case is not one in which the Complainant’s serious injuries, even if caused only by police officers’ actions, were caused illegally, as I explain below.Since the Complainant had been caught engaging in breaking and entering, the police were lawfully entitled to arrest the Complainant without a warrant. The Complainant, by responding to this lawful arrest with extreme physical resistance, in turn granted the police officers the right, pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, to use reasonable force in order to subdue him.Can it be said, therefore, that any police officer, when struggling with the Complainant, used unreasonable – and hence unlawful – force against him? In my view, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude as much.  Though there is no doubt that the cumulative force used against the Complainant was significant - multiple hand strikes and ASP blows,OCspray, and aCEWdischarge – there is similarly no doubt that the Complainant was vigorously resisting his arrest, even striking out himself at the officers with arms and legs.  In the course of this melee, it is apparent that the officers escalated their use of force only when it was clear that lesser force was not accomplishing the task at hand, namely, effecting the Complainant’s arrest.  It is also important to bear in mind the broader context in which the officers were confronted by persons who had just been caught committing a serious offence and determined to drive away.  In the circumstances, there was some imperative in ensuring that the Complainant and his associates were taken into custody as quickly as possible in the interests of public safety.  On this record, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the force used by the officers was measured, proportionate and, ultimately, lawful.For the foregoing reasons, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against any police officer in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	January 6, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1023
,Kingston Police,Kingston,Ontario,He was diagnosed with four fractured right-sided ribs a fracture to the left foot a partial right-sided pneumothorax and numerous bruises,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  The officers who attended at the address on Ford Street seeking to place the Complainant into custody were in the lawful discharge of their duty.  They were aware that the Complainant was armed with a knife, extremely agitated and violent, and had just attacked occupants  of the residence, inflicting serious injury.  There were ample grounds to arrest the Complainant for any number of offences, including assault with a weapon.Thereafter, I am satisfied that the subject officers never exceeded the ambit of reasonably necessary force to effect their purpose.  At the direction ofSO#5, the police operation that unfolded over about 12 hours was demonstrably geared at a peaceful resolution of the standoff.  Every effort was undertaken to negotiate the Complainant’s surrender to police.  Trained negotiators, a mental health professional and the Complainant’s own mother were all given an opportunity to persuade the Complainant to drop his knife and exit the home.  Regrettably, the Complainant could not be reasoned with.  Only when it was abundantly clear that negotiation would not work didSO#5 begin to pursue a more aggressive approach.  Here, too, the tactic was to first deploy tear gas andOCgas from a distance in the hope that the Complainant would be driven from his position of advantage inside the home in a weakened condition from the debilitating effects of the gas.  It was only when that also failed, the Complainant seemingly impervious to the gas, that the officers began to use the less lethal weapons at their disposal, namely, a police dog,ARWENs andCEWs, to apply direct physical force at the Complainant.  But for the finalCEWandARWENdischarges, the Complainant was unaffected by this force, even settling and petting the dog at one moment in the bedroom.  On this record, faced with an armed and violent individual over a protracted engagement, I am satisfied that the force used by the officers was at every turn commensurate and proportionate to the exigencies of the situation.It remains unclear whether any of the injuries suffered by the Complainant were directly inflicted by the police.  In fact, it is possible and perhaps even likely that some if not all of the injuries happened in the course of the physical altercations with the residents  that preceded the police presence or his feverish movements inside the home where he was seen to collide with household items.  Be that as it may, as there are no reasonable grounds on the aforementioned-record to believe that the subject officers acted other than lawfully throughout the course of the standoff, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	April 6, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1275
,Ontario Provincial Police,Dryden,Ontario,nCause of Death The pathologist at autopsy was of the view that the Complainant’s death was attributable to a gunshot wound of the head,"The offence that arises for consideration iscriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The offence captures conduct that reveals a reckless or wanton disregard for the lives or safety of others.  Liability is predicated, in part, on behaviour that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care in the manner in whichSO#1 and/orSO#2 dealt with the Complainant that caused or contributed to his death.  In my view, there was not.Both officers were part of a lawful week-long police operation aimed at finding the Complainant.  The police, having inspected his abandoned car and spoken with his parents, had good cause to believe that the Complainant was in mental distress and a threat to himself and, possibly, others.  A police officer’s foremost obligation is the protection and preservation of life.  TheOPPwas duty bound to look for the Complainant.The search and rescue operation, by all appearances, was conducted professionally.  Specially trained officers –ERTmembers - were brought to the area to look for the Complainant.  Over the course of several days, searches of various tracts of land around the Complainant’s abandoned vehicle and reported sightings of the Complainant were performed.  The searches included the use of a helicopter and police dogs.  A forensic psychiatrist was consulted, who provided advice regarding the Complainant’s potential motivations and whereabouts.  While the Complainant was able to elude the police, at times, seemingly, breaking-in to various premises in the area for shelter and other items, I am satisfied it was not for want of trying by the police.I am further satisfied that the involved officers conducted themselves reasonably when they found and confronted the Complainant in the afternoon of September 19, 2020.  Realizing that the Complainant was mentally unwell, they approached the situation with tact.SO#1 appears to have taken the lead in talking with the Complainant.  The officer reassured him that the police were there to help him.  Food and accommodations were offered to the Complainant, as well as an opportunity to speak with his parents and see a doctor.  So as to not excite or scare the Complainant, the helicopter in the air that was part of the search efforts was asked to keep its distance.  And it was only when the Complainant was seen with a rifle in his hand by his side thatSO#1 armed himself with a C8 rifle.  By that time, the Complainant, whom the officers had no reason to believe was armed, suddenly constituted a real and present danger to himself and those around him.  Though the Complainant indicated the firearm was for hunting, the officers had every reason to be concerned about the health and safety of everyone involved given the Complainant’s precarious mental state.  In the circumstances, it would appear that the police acted reasonably in positioning officers around the Complainant with the intention of containing his movements and, eventually, effecting his apprehension under section 17 of theMental Health Act.  It is highly regrettable that the Complainant chose to shoot himself as the officers desperately implored him to stop, but, in the final analysis, I am of the view that he did so through no fault of the police.  As for the possible deployment of less lethal weapons to incapacitate the Complainant, it should be noted that one of the officers present had anARWEN.  However, given the officer’s distance from the Complainant at the time, necessitated by the Complainant’s possession of a firearm, there was never a realistic opportunity to deploy the weapon.  Finally, following the shooting, the officers acted with dispatch in rendering what aid they could to the Complainant and enlisted the services of the helicopter to fly the Complainant to hospital.In the result, as I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons thatSO#1 andSO#2 comported themselves within the law throughout their engagement with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against either officer, and the file is closed.Date:	June 21, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1413
,Halton Regional Police Service,Halton,Ontario,The driver of the truck CW 1 was fortunate to have escaped the collision with only minor injuries,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances. In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which theSOoperated his cruiser and whether it was sufficiently derelict to attract criminal sanction. In my view, there was not.TheSOwas within his rights in initiating a pursuit of the Honda.  He had reason to believe that the driver of the vehicle was the same person who had just been reported to have damaged a storefront on Main Street East and fled from the scene in a Honda Fit.  The Honda had also just travelled past him at speeds well in excess of the 60 km/h speed limit on Thompson Road South – a clear traffic infraction.Once on Thompson Road South, the evidence indicates that theSOalso reached significant speeds – between 110 and 120 km/h for stretches.  This was to be expected if the officer was going to gain any ground on the Honda.  However, as soon as it became clear that the Honda was traveling too fast and out of reach, theSOmade the decision, wisely in my view, to bring the active pursuit to an end.  He advised the police dispatcher accordingly, de-activated his emergency lights and decelerated.  While on Thompson Road South, the officer’sICCSestablishes that no third-parties were ever placed at risk by the officer’s cruiser notwithstanding theSO’s speed at points.TheSOalso exceeded the speed limit on Derry Road while traveling west in the direction the Honda had taken, but his speeds were less pronounced than they had been on Thompson Road South, topping out at 95 km/h.  Again, there is no indication that any other motorists were placed at risk by the officer’s cruiser.There is also no suggestion that theSOunduly pushed Complainant #1 or fueled his reckless driving. The officer was at all times well back of the Honda, and arrived at the scene of the intersection no sooner than some ten to 20 seconds after the collision had occurred.Finally, it is worth noting that the environmental conditions at the time did not aggravate the risks inherent in any pursuit.  The weather was clear, traffic was moderate and the roads were dry and in good repair.In the result, as there is no reason on the aforementioned-record to believe that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law, there is no basis for proceeding with charges against the officer.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Armour,Ontario,nCause of Death The pathologist at autopsy attributed the Complainant’s death to multiple gunshot wounds,"Pursuant to section 34 of theCriminal Code, the use of force that would otherwise constitute an offence is legally justified provided it was intended in the defence of oneself or another from a reasonably apprehended attacked, actual or threatened, and was itself reasonable.  With respect to the reasonableness of the force, it is to be assessed against all the relevant circumstances, including with respect to such considerations as: the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon; and, the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force.  In my view, the force used by theSOfell within the four corners of the justification set out in section 34.I accept that theSOdischarged his C8 rifle believing it was necessary to protect himself and others around him, including other officers and civilians in the area, from a lethal risk presented by the Complainant.  That is what the officer told theSIU, and that is what is borne out by the circumstances.  Though the shotgun in the possession of the Complainant was unloaded, the officer would not have known that.  In fact, just the opposite; he had learned over the radio moments before the shooting that the shotgun was loaded.  Confronted by a seemingly operable firearm pointed in his direction, I am satisfied that theSOacted to thwart a threat of imminent death to himself and others.I am further satisfied that theSO’s use of force was reasonable.  For starters, the officer was lawfully placed at the time he approached the Complainant and subsequently shot him.  An officer’s foremost duty is the protection and preservation of life, and theSOwas in the lawful execution of his duty as he responded to the scene following reports of a suicidal Complainant armed with a gun.  Thereafter, when the Complainant emerged from the home and adopted a defiant posture, weapon in hand, as he strolled south toward the intersection, he constituted a clear and present danger to the well-being of theSOand other officers in the area, as well as civilians in and around their homes.  Accordingly, the officer was within his rights in tracking the Complainant southward and challenging his continued movements.The exigencies of the moment speak to the reasonableness of theSO’s actions. The officer was within two to three metres of the Complainant at the time of the shooting.  To reiterate, the Complainant had turned in theSO’s direction pointing what the officer could only assume was a fully loaded and functional shotgun.  At that moment, theSOwas faced with imminent death with nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.  In the circumstances, it is difficult to see what else the officer could have done other than to discharge his weapon if he was to preserve himself.The context around the shooting is also instructive.  The Complainant was intent on provoking what he hoped would be a lethal confrontation with police.  He had made that clear just before the officers’ arrival when he talked about wanting “death by cop”.  Though theSOwould not have been privy to that information at the time, the Complainant’s motivation lends credence to theSO’s perceptions at the time, namely, that the Complainant’s conduct left him no choice but to fire his weapon.  Moreover, it is important to note that theSOhad already shown a significant degree of restraint.  Arguably, though the Complainant’s behaviour before the shooting, as he stepped onto the sidewalk and then started walking south toward Third Street, presented an immediate risk of death or grievous bodily harm to theSOand others, the officer chose first to engage him verbally and then with hisCEW.  It was only when those options failed to neutralize the Complainant that theSOturned to his firearm.Finally, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOacted excessively with respect to the number of shots he fired – 11 in total.  The officer explained that he fired his weapon until the Complainant fell to the ground and was no longer a threat.  Given the rapidity with which theSOfired his weapon, and the weight of the witness evidence indicating that the Complainant fell after the final shot was discharged, I accept the officer’s evidence at its word.  On this record, with the Complainant on his feet with a shotgun in hand until the final shot, I am satisfied that theSO’s apprehensions regarding the nature of the threat and the necessity of resorting to his C8 rifle, remained reasonable throughout the period of gunfire.In the result, as I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that theSOcomported himself other than lawfully throughout his encounter with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,With the arrival of a paramedic CW 5 who had been called to the scene to dislodge the CEW probes the Complainant angered again began to utter epithets at the officers and the paramedic and refused to be treated,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.WO#1 andWO#3 had lawful cause to take the Complainant into custody.  He had jumped onto a vehicle and stomped on its hood, damaging it.  In the circumstances, he was liable to arrest for mischief.  The issue turns to the propriety of the force used by the officers.The gravamen of the force used against the Complainant consisted of punches to the face and chest area by theSO.  Though very likely responsible for the Complainant’s facial injuries, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO’s conduct fell afoul of the limits imposed by the criminal law.  On the clear weight of the evidence, the officer’s volleys of punches were in reaction to the Complainant taking hold of his handgun in its holster.  In the context of the vigour with which the Complainant had resisted the officers’ efforts to that point, theSO, I am satisfied, would have had reason to believe that his life, as well as the lives of those around him, was in imminent peril in the event the Complainant managed to take possession of the gun.  On this record, it seems to me that the officer acted reasonably when he punched at the Complainant, particularly as verbal commands and brute manpower had been unsuccessful to that point in having him release his hold of the weapon.With respect to the use ofCEWs against the Complainant, I am also satisfied that this force fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary at the time to take and maintain him in custody.  By the time of the firstCEWdischarges, the Complainant had punchedWO#3 andWO#1.  By the time ofWO#2’s second two discharges, the Complainant had leapt to his feet and was charging in the officer’s direction. Given the Complainant’s level of aggression, the crowd of onlookers in the vicinity, and the fact that this was occurring within live lanes of traffic,WO#3 andWO#2 were within their rights in attempting to neutralize the Complainant from a distance with use of theirCEWs.  Once on the ground and held by officers, there is no indication of any furtherCEWdischarges at the Complainant.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOor the other officers involved in the Complainant’s arrest transgressed the criminal law in their dealings with him, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

As an offence of penal negligence, liability for the crime is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which theSOengaged with the Complainant that contributed to his death and / or was sufficiently egregious as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas in the lawful performance of his duty when he set after the Complainant on Darling Street.  The Complainant had been involved in a physical altercation with an occupant of the BMW, a dispute which continued on the roadways as the Complainant’s Infiniti aggressively followed the BMW.  By the time the officers got involved, the Complainant had blown through two-stop signs.  He was clearly subject to being stopped forHTAinfractions.Once engaged, there is little evidence that theSOdid not comport himself with due regard for the safety of the public.  In fact, it appears on the weight of the evidence that theSOquickly abandoned any thoughts of a high speed pursuit of the Infiniti as it turned from Dalhousie Street to travel north on Brant Avenue, if not sooner.  From that point forward, the evidence establishes that the Infiniti was well ahead of theSO’s cruiser, if not out of sight altogether, and that the officer had resolved to simply follow in the Infiniti’s direction at moderate speeds.  As he did so, there is no indication of any dangerous driving on the part of the officer either by way of protracted speed in excess of the speed limit or roadway maneuvers.  On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO, at any point, transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.In the result, as there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that theSOacted other than lawfully in his brief engagement with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against the officer and the file is closed.Date:	April 20, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1340

In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care on the part of theSOthat caused or contributed to the collision and was sufficiently derelict such as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.TheSOwas acting in the course of his duties when he decided to pursue the Porsche after it had failed to stop and accelerated way from the police.  His partner had recorded the vehicle in excess of the speed limit and given its driver a clear indication to stop.  Pursuant to O. Reg. 266/10, the regulation governing police pursuits in the province, officers are entitled to initiate a pursuit for aHighway Traffic Actinfraction as long as the balance of public safety considerations is not prohibitive.  At least at the outset, I am satisfied there was no such prohibition apparent in the circumstances that prevailed.Thereafter, it is clear that the pursuit was all but over shortly after it began.  By the time the officers began to accelerate eastward after the Porsche, the vehicle had disappeared from view and was quickly approaching Keele Street.  While it is apparent that theSOreached speeds in excess of 80 km/h for a brief period as he attempted to gain ground on the Porsche, it is clear that he failed to do so and was well back of the vehicle when the collision occurred.  In that short period of time, over a distance no longer than about 800 metres, the officer did proceed through a red light without stopping at Sentinel Road and occasionally drove in left turn lanes for westbound traffic.  While theSOought to have fully stopped at the red light pursuant to section 144(20) of theHighway Traffic Act, theICCSrecording reveals that he slowed significantly on approach to the Sentinel road intersection before safely proceeding through it.  Nor is there any evidence that third-party motorists had to take any evasive action in response to the cruiser, even when it travelled in the wrong way in the left turn lanes.  It is also worth noting that theSOhad his emergency lights on the entire time and siren sounding intermittently while traveling over dry roads in good weather, factors which tempered the risks associated with the officer’s upper end speed.On the aforementioned-record, I am satisfied that theSOconducted himself within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law in the course of a very brief pursuit, and that the driver of the Porsche, left with every opportunity to abort his reckless driving had he been so inclined, is alone responsible for the collision.

,Windsor Police Service,Aylmer,Ontario,The SO suffered a compound fracture requiring surgery,"The offence that arises for consideration iscriminal negligence causing bodily harmcontrary to section 221 of theCriminal Code.[3]A simple lack of care will not suffice to ground liability for the offence; what is required is a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  While theSOappears largely to blame for the collision, I am unable to reasonably conclude on the evidence that his transgressions ran afoul of the limits prescribed by the criminal law.Pursuant to section 144(20) of theHighway Traffic Act, the driver of an emergency vehicle (including police vehicles) may proceed through a red light but only when it is safe to do so after first coming to a stop.  TheSOfailed to do so.  And his failure, in my view, directly contributed to the collision in question.  The Complainant was operating his motorcycle safely in and around the speed limit.  Had theSOcome to a full stop and taken stock of traffic around him, the officer should have noticed the motorcyclist and, presumably, waited until traffic had cleared before continuing on his way.On the other hand, the evidence indicates that theSO’s speed on approach to McDougall Street was moderate and that he was slowing, and probably even skidding, as he entered the intersection.  Moreover, there is nothing in the record to suggest that theSOhad been cycling in a reckless manner in the moments prior to the collision.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that theSO’s indiscretion may best be classified as a momentary lapse of attention and insufficient to establish a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable level of care.In the result, as I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOcommitted a criminal offence in connection with the collision involving the Complainant and his motorcycle, there is no basis to proceed with criminal charges in this case.

,York Regional Police,Richmond Hill,Ontario,Following the Complainant’s arrest he was taken in ambulance to hospital where he was admitted for psychiatric examination and diagnosed with a fracture of the right hand,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  Given the information the officers had been provided at dispatch of the 911 call, indicating that the Complainant was in the throes of a mental health crisis in which he was threatening himself and others with a pair of scissors, and what they gathered first-hand as they arrived at the scene and attempted to engage with the Complainant, I am satisfied there were grounds to take the Complainant into custody pursuant to section 17 of theMHA.As for the force that was used in the Complainant’s apprehension, I am also satisfied that it fell within the latitude of permissible force.  Prior to theARWENandCEWdischarges,YRPofficers had attended at the scene and set up a perimeter around it to prevent the public’s access to the park but also the Complainant’s egress from the field.  The Complainant had with him a pair of scissors and the officers were prudent in restricting his movements and those in the vicinity.  Efforts were made by the officers at de-escalation.  A number of them tried speaking with the Complainant, but he was unreceptive given his mental state at the time.  It was only when the Complainant approachedWO#1 and theSOat the east end of the soccer field to within a few metres that the officers discharged their weapons.  Though faced with an edged object with the potential to inflict grievous bodily harm or death, the officers responded with less lethal weapons – their CEWS and anARWEN.  When this level of force, including theCEWdischarges byWO#6 andWO#5, did not fell or otherwise incapacitate the Complainant,WO#1 and theSOmoved in to physically subdue the Complainant and take him to the ground.  On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the force used by the police against the Complainant was other than a proportionate and commensurate response to the exigencies of the situation.In the result, as I am not reasonably satisfied that theSOacted unlawfully in the force he used to take the Complainant into custody, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	June 14, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1391

,Toronto Police Service,Grey,Ontario,She was placed under arrest and taken to hospital by ambulance where she was diagnosed with a fractured sternum,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which theSOpursued the Complainant sufficient to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.At the outset, it bears noting that theSOwas in the discharge of his lawful duties when he came upon the Complainant’s vehicle and decided to pursue it.  Given what he had heard over the radio about a firearm being discharged andWO#6’s subsequent broadcast suggesting the perpetrator was fleeing the scene in a Hyundai, theSOhad grounds to believe the Complainant had committed a criminal offence.  Accordingly, the officer was within his rights in initiating a pursuit under O. Reg. 266/10, which regulates police pursuits in the province.Thereafter, there are aspects of the manner in which theSOoperated his cruiser that are open to legitimate scrutiny.  Needless to say, Toronto’s downtown city streets do not lend themselves to the safe conduct of high speed pursuits at the best of times.  While theSOdoes not appear to have reached the speeds of the Complainant, upwards of 145 km/h in the seconds prior to the collision, he did sustain velocities in the neighbourhood of 130 km/h at points northward on Parliament Street.  This was grossly in excess of the 40 km/h speed limit which governed some if not all of the roadway along the pursuit route.  I am also satisfied on the evidence that theSOtravelled through at least one red traffic control light without stopping, and possibly others, in violation of section 144(20) of theHighway Traffic Act.On the other hand, there were a number of extenuating considerations at play that tempered the risks inherent in any pursuit and, in particular, this one.  The weather was good, the roads were dry and, given the time of day, there was very little vehicular and pedestrian activity in the vicinity of the pursuit.  In the circumstances, though the pursuit travelled through areas that were a mix of commercial and residential premises, the environmental conditions that prevailed at the time did not unduly aggravate the danger to public safety.  The use by theSOof his emergency lights and siren throughout the pursuit further mitigated the perils associated with the officer’s speed and travel through intersections.  What little traffic there was on the roadway would have been afforded an opportunity to take notice of the pursuit and adjust their movements accordingly.  In similar vein, it does not appear that theSO’s cruiser was at any point the cause of any evasive action by third-parties.  Worth noting as well is section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act, which exempts police vehicles from the speed limitations where they are being used in the lawful performance of an officer’s duty.  While the section does not provide police officers carte blanche to speed as they wish without regard for public safety, it does provide a measure of immunity where an officer’s speed is commensurate with the law enforcement objectives at hand.  This was not a case where the balance of risks clearly favoured a less aggressive pursuit or a termination of the pursuit altogether at some point prior to the collision.  Given the nature of the crime for which the Complainant was being pursued - a serious firearm offence – theSOcould reasonably believe that the need to immediately apprehend the Complainant outweighed the risks to public safety being created by the pursuit.On the aforementioned-record, I find that the dangers associated with the pursuit in this case fall short of rendering theSO’s conduct a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.

,London Police Service,London,Ontario,The Complainant was transported by ambulance to the UH in London where she was diagnosed with a fracture to the radial bone in one of her arms,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code. As a crime of penal negligence, liability for the offence is not made out unless the conduct in question amounts to a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances. I am satisfied that the manner in which theSOoperated his cruiser in the moments leading to the collision did not transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.As section 141(5) of theHTAmakes clear, there is a heavy onus on motorists to refrain from making left turns at intersections unless they can do so safely. It would appear that the Complainant failed in that obligation. While the Complainant initially slowed her vehicle as it entered the intersection, the video evidence establishes that she then accelerated into her left turn directly into the path of theSO, who was unable to avoid a collision.At play in the collision was a truck stopped at the intersection facing north and waiting for southbound traffic to clear before making a left turn onto Nelson Street. Its presence and position created a visual obstruction such that theSOand the Complainant were unable to see each other as they approached the intersection from opposite directions. That was all the more reason, however, for the Complainant to take added precautions before making her left turn. Unfortunately, instead of “inching forward” or refraining from making her left turn altogether until the obstruction was gone, the Complainant accelerated past the truck and into the path of the cruiser.Arguably, theSO, approaching as he was a visual obstruction, ought to have contemplated the potential presence of a left-turning vehicle and slowed his cruiser. Instead, it appears he maintained a fairly constant velocity of about 70 km/h as he neared and then entered into the intersection. This was in excess of the 50 km/h speed limit in the area. That said, it bears noting that theSO, on my review of the video evidence, was traveling at about the same speed as other traffic proceeding through the intersection in the moments before the collision. This does not excuse the officer’s speed, but it is a mitigating factor in the reasonableness assessment of the Complainant’s conduct.In the final analysis, weighed in the balance against the Complainant’s overriding obligation to ensure she could complete her turn in safety, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO’s speed – above the speed limit but in keeping with the flow of traffic around him – amounted to a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.

,Brockville Police Service,Augusta,Ontario,Ayala-Guerrero’s death to “multiple blunt force injures”,"The offence that arises for consideration iscriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care on the part of the officers that caused or contributed to Mr. Ayala-Guerrero’s fall and was sufficiently derelict to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.SO#2 andSO#1 were engaged in the exercise of their lawful duties when they spotted Mr. Ayala-Guerrero and decided they would endeavor to arrest him.  They were apprised of information that Mr. Ayala-Guerrero was the suspect in a recent murder in Texas, with respect to which a warrant against him had been issued, and that he was in the Brockville area.  They were also aware that a nationwide arrest warrant had been issued by the Canada Border Services Agency.  In the circumstances, when they spotted Mr. Ayala-Guerrero on the North Augusta Road overpass, the officers were within their rights in attempting to take him into custody.Thereafter, I am unable to find fault with the manner in which they approached Mr. Ayala-Guerrero.  They could not have known that Mr. Ayala-Guerrero, faced with his pending apprehension, would take the drastic action he did.  When it became apparent within seconds ofSO#2’s exit from the cruiser that Mr. Ayala-Guerrero was scaling the bridge railing, the officer did what he could to save him.  He shouted at Mr. Ayala-Guerrero to stop and tried to grab him to prevent his fall.SO#2 had barely made contact with Mr. Ayala-Guerrero when he jumped to the ground below.  Following the fall,SO#2 quickly made his way to Mr. Ayala-Guerrero and pulled him onto the highway’s shoulder to prevent any further injury.  Regrettably, the damage had been done.  On this record, I am satisfied thatSO#2 andSO#1, the latter still exiting the cruiser when Mr. Ayala-Guerrero fell, comported themselves with due care and regard for Mr. Ayala-Guerrero’s health and safety.In the result, as I am satisfied thatSO#2 andSO#1 acted lawfully throughout their encounter with Mr. Ayala-Guerrero, there is no basis for criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	February 16, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1132
,Toronto Police Service,Harley,Ontario,Paramedics arrived at the scene and took the Complainant to hospital where he was diagnosed with several facial fractures and fractures of the right leg,"The offence that arises for consideration iscriminal negligence causing bodily harmcontrary to section 221 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether theSOstepped out into the roadway to perform a traffic stop with a reasonable level of care and, if not, whether the officer was so remiss in his conduct as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that any transgressions on the part of theSOfell afoul of the criminal law.For starters, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOwas in the lawful discharge of his duties when he decided to stop the Malibu for a speeding infraction.  Thereafter, despite what appears to have been a late stop signal directed atCW#1, the driver of the Malibu, the evidence falls short of establishing any criminal negligence on the part of theSOin the performance of his duty.  While theSOmay have been very close to the Malibu when he first stepped onto the roadway, the fact remains that bothCW#1 andCW#2 had seen the officer and were able to come to safe, albeit quick, stops.  As for why the Complainant was not similarly able to bring his vehicle to a stop, the answer appears to have had something to do with less than careful driving on his part.  Thus, there is some evidence that the Complainant was weaving in and out of the curb and passing lanes on the approach to Lakehurst Drive, and riding the “line”, that is, cradling the lanes.  On this record, while it might have been that theSOought to have allowed for a greater stopping distance before signaling traffic to pull over, his failure to do was something less than a marked and substantial deviation from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.In the result, while I accept that theSO’s conduct set in train a series of events that resulted in injuries to the Complainant, I am satisfied that the officer comported himself within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

,York Regional Police,King,Ontario,xa0 r\n\xa0 nCause of Death nThe preliminary cause of death was determined to be “Blunt force injuries,"The offences that arise for consideration aredangerous driving causing deathandcriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to sections 320.13(3) and 220 of theCriminal Code, respectively.  The former is predicated, in part, on conduct that that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  The latter is a more serious offence and requires a finding that the conduct in question constitutes a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable level of care.  In the instant case, the issue is whether theSOwas derelict in the manner in which he operated his cruiser during his short pursuit of the Honda and, if so, whether his dereliction caused or contributed to the collision that took Mr. Bertini’s life and was sufficiently wanting as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there are no reasonable grounds in the evidence to believe that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.The evidence establishes that theSOconducted himself professionally and with due care and regard for public safety.  He was in the lawful execution of his duties performing speed enforcement when he clocked the Honda traveling at 125 km/h, more than twice the 60 km/h speed limit.  In the circumstances, theSOwas within his rights to initiate a pursuit for a serious traffic infraction.  The evidence indicates he did so safely, activating his emergency lights as the Honda approached his location and performing a U-turn to travel south on Keele Street.  TheSObriefly reached a speed in excess of 100 km/h, which is not surprising as he attempted to make up ground on a speeding vehicle.  However, the officer quickly realized the Honda was too far ahead and, in my view, wisely shut down the pursuit.  By the time of the collision, the cruiser was well back of the Honda Accord in distance and time.  There is no suggestion on this record that theSOunduly fueled the Honda driver’s reckless driving or otherwise prevented the driver from slowing the vehicle and adopting a safer course.  Tragically, the Honda continued at speed, striking and killing Mr. Bertini whose only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time.In the result, as I am satisfied on the aforementioned-record that theSOcomported himself at all times within the law in the course of a very brief pursuit of the Honda, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against the officer.

I am satisfied that theSOwas in the execution of his lawful duties as he chased after the Complainant.

,Toronto Police Service,Kingston,Ontario,The SO did not sustain any serious injury in the collision,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code. As a crime of penal negligence, criminal liability for the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances. It is plain and obvious that neither the Complainant norCW#1 are to blame for their motorcycle’s collision with the police cruiser. By all accounts,CW#1 was traveling safely at moderate speed when he lawfully entered the intersection intending to continue west past Harewood Avenue.On the other hand, there is a heavy onus on motorists, including police officers in the execution of their duties, to refrain from making left turns unless it is safe to do so. It is not clear to me that theSOmet his burden in embarking on the turn. I accept that theSO, having cleared two westbound lanes in front of traffic that had stopped for him, believed it was safe for him to proceed when he maneuvered into the curb lane to complete his turn; indeed, it is likely that the stopped motorists may well have created a sightline obstruction between the police cruiser and the advancing motorcycle. Be that as it may, having entered into a turn in circumstances in which he could not be assured there was no oncoming traffic in the curb lane, it strikes me that theSOis largely responsible for the collision that occurred.The situation might have been different had theSO’s emergency lighting or siren been on as he entered the intersection. Not only might the sights and sounds of theSO’s vehicle have alertedCW#1 to theSO’s presence in the intersection, perhaps averting a collision, it would have created a positive duty on motorists in the vicinity to give way to the police cruiser. Regrettably, the emergency lights and siren were not on at the time.Notwithstanding the officer’s seeming indiscretions, the evidence does not establish that theSO’s driving departed markedly from a reasonable level standard of care. Though theSOought to have used his emergency equipment, and ought not to have started into his turn without assuring himself that it was safe to cut across all three lanes of westbound traffic, his miscalculation can fairly be characterized as more in the nature of a misjudgment than recklessness. For example, theSOproceeded with deliberate pace through his turn before entering into the curb lane, demonstrating a degree of vigilance. Moreover, there is no indication of any careless or dangerous driving on theSO’s part in the moments before the collision. As for the environmental conditions, aside from vehicular traffic that seems to have been on the heavy side, these were of little consequence in the analysis of the reasonableness of theSO’s conduct: the roads were dry and the weather was clear.In the result, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO’s lapses transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law when weighed in the balance with the aforementioned extenuating considerations. Accordingly, while I accept that theSOcaused the collision that regrettably caused serious injuries to the Complainant, there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges against theSO.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Armour,Ontario,Hegedus’ death to “[g]unshot wound of right back”,"Pursuant to section 34 of theCriminal Code, the use of force that would otherwise constitute an offence is legally justified provided it was intended in the defence of oneself or another from a reasonably apprehended attacked, actual or threatened, and was itself reasonable.  With respect to the reasonableness of the force, it is to be assessed against all the relevant circumstances, including with respect to such considerations as: the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; the person’s role in the incident; whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon; and, the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force.  In my view, the force used bySO#1 andSO#2 fell within the four corners of the justification set out in section 34.At the outset, it is important to note thatSO#1 andSO#2 were engaged in the lawful execution of their duties as they approached Mr. Hegedus’ property and then engaged him in gunfire.  By that time, Mr. Hegedus had assaulted two employees of a Valu-mart, driven dangerously, including in the direction of persons, and fired twice atWO#1.  He was clearly subject to arrest, and to arrest as quickly as possible given his acts of violence.In their interviews with theSIU,SO#1 andSO#2 indicated that they fired their weapons in fear of their, and each other’s, lives.  There is nothing in the record to cast doubt on those assertions.  On the contrary, the circumstances were such as to lend credence to their evidence in this regard.SO#1 had just been fired upon by Mr. Hegedus at a range of about 20 metres or so.  On this record, I am confident that the officers returned fire believing it to be necessary to protect themselves from death or grievous bodily harm.I am further satisfied that the multiple rounds discharged by each officer at Mr. Hegedus – nine and 19 rounds bySO#1 andSO#2, respectively – amounted to reasonable force.  There can be little doubt that Mr. Hegedus was intent on killing police officers, whose arrival at his address he would have known was imminent following his antics at the Valu-mart.  Returning from the store, Mr. Hegedus had changed into a camouflaged jacket, armed himself with a rifle and handgun with an abundance of ammunition for both weapons, taken a position of concealment in and around his home, and fired twice already atWO#1, who was fortunate not to have been struck.  Coming upon Mr. Hegedus in a wooded area north of his property and east of Indian Point Road,SO#1 andSO#2 ordered him repeatedly to show his hands.  Mr. Hegedus chose not to do so, instead rising from a crouched position behind a tree stump and firing atSO#1.  In that instant, the officers’ lives were in grave danger and they acted reasonably and proportionately, in my view, in resorting to lethal force of their own.  Retreat or withdrawal were not realistic options in the moment.SO#1 was in a vulnerable position out in the roadway when Mr. Hegedus first fired his weapon; any delay incurred in seeking cover would potentially have placed his life at further risk.  The same can be said with respect toSO#2, who had every reason to believe that defending his life and, more emphatically,SO#1’s life, was dependent on immediately neutralizing Mr. Hegedus.  Finally, in the context of an individual who had intentionally made himself difficult to see, and evidence suggesting Mr. Hegedus fired up to three additional shots after the officers had returned fire following his first discharge, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the number of shots fired by the officers was excessive.  In arriving at this conclusion, I am mindful of the fact that Mr. Hegedus was only struck by three (and possibly just two) rounds, and that the gunfire occurred with rapidity and ceased when it was clear that Mr. Hegedus was down and no longer a threat.In the final analysis, while it remains unclear which of Mr. Hegedus’ gunshot wounds were caused by which officer, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that eitherSO#1 orSO#2 acted other than lawfully throughout this incident.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	June 14, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1392

,Hamilton Police Service,Grey,Ontario,r\n\nCause of Death nThe pathologist at autopsy attributed the Complainant’s death to a “gunshot wound of the back of the head”,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  In the case of lethal force, section 25(3) further stipulates that such force is not justified unless the officer reasonably believed it was necessary for his or her self-preservation, or the protection of a person under their charge, from death or grievous bodily harm.  In the instant case, I am satisfied that the shots fired bySO#1 andSO#2 fell within the ambit of legal justification.The subject officers were engaged in the discharge of their lawful duties when they responded to the parking lot of the convenience store looking to apprehend the Complainant.  They were aware of information from a 911 call that the Complainant had just left the residence of an estranged partner whom he had confined and threatened with a sawed-off shotgun.  Police had also spoken with the Complainant’s brother as they responded to deal with the 911 call, who confirmed that the Complainant had access to firearms.Though neither subject officer provided a statement to theSIU, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest they did not believe that shooting the Complainant was necessary if they were to protect themselves and others in the vicinity from death or grievous bodily harm.  Just the opposite.  The circumstances were such that I am satisfied that bothSO#1 andSO#2 were reasonably of that mindset.  Surrounded by police officers and with nowhere to go, the Complainant made it instantly clear that he was not about to peacefully surrender to police.  Instead, he took hold of his shotgun, aimed it in the direction of the driver’s seat, and fired a round towardWO#4 as he was attempting to pullCW#1 from the Buick.  It is astonishing that neitherWO#4 norCW#1 were killed.  When that occurred,SO#1 andSO#2 had little option other than to return fire.  There were two other individuals in the Buick and civilians in the area, and the Complainant had already shown a propensity for forcible confinement.  In the circumstances, withdrawing from the scene was untenable as it risked the very real possibility of a further hostage situation.  More to the point, the subject officers were then and there confronted with an armed individual they had every reason to believe would again fire his weapon.  Given the nature of the threat,SO#1 andSO#2 had the right to defend themselves and, I am persuaded, to do so with resort to their firearms.In the result, as I am satisfied on reasonable grounds thatSO#1 andSO#2 acted lawfully throughout their interaction with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Halton Regional Police Service,Halton,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured left pelvis and left humerus,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  In my view, there is no evidence to reasonably conclude that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.There is a heavy onus on the operators of motor vehicles to be ever mindful of the presence of other users of the road, particularly pedestrians and cyclists in the vicinity given their relative vulnerability.  In the instant case, theSOwas traveling at a moderate and safe speed as he entered into his right-hand turn onto Thompson Road South.  He did so on a green light and at a time when the same traffic control signal was flashing red for pedestrians, requiring users of the crosswalk to refrain from entering the intersection.  The officer says that he simply did not see the Complainant until she suddenly appeared at his front passenger side and collided with his cruiser.  While I accept theSO’s account on this point, the question is whether he was keeping a proper lookout and ought to have seen the Complainant.  While there is evidence that cuts both ways on this issue, the fact that it was dark at the time and that the Complainant appears to have entered the intersection on a bicycle that did not have a forward facing light leads me to conclude that the officer’s oversight, if it was such, did not amount to a pronounced lack of care sufficient to ground criminal liability.On the aforementioned-record, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that theSOran afoul of the criminal law vis-à-vis the collision with the Complainant.

,Halton Regional Police Service,Brampton,Ontario,n r\n The following scenario emerges on the evidence collected by the SIU which included interviews with the Complainant and the SO as well as a number of other officers and civilian witnesses who observed parts of the events in question The investigation also benefitted significantly by video recordings from a police helicopter and a commercial premises that captured the incident In the evening of June 30 2020 a team of PRP tactical officers led by the SO was asked by PRP robbery investigators to assist in the arrest of persons suspected of committing a series of violent carjackings There had been a spike of these crimes in recent weeks in Peel Region and the Greater Toronto Area often times targeting Range Rovers Typically the suspects would stage a minor collision with the vehicle whereupon they would accost the driver after he or she exited the vehicle brandishing a gun or knife beat them if there was any resistance and drive off with the vehicle By June 30 2020 a number of vehicles used by the perpetrators of these crimes including a black Ford Mustang as well as several suspects had been identified by PRP robbery investigators The Complainant was among the suspects Earlier in the day PRP robbery investigators had received word from York Regional Police officers with whom they were collaborating on the carjacking investigation of one such incident in Markham Two men had approached a black Range Rover pistol whipped the owner in the head and drove off in his vehicle The Ford Mustang was involved in the robbery Several hours later PRP learned from the Halton Regional Police Service that the same Ford Mustang had followed a woman in her white Range Rover to her residence in Oakville As the driver pulled into her garage a male exited the Mustang ran up to the Range Rover and attempted to open the door The driver reversed out of the garage and the male fled the scene in the Mustang The male was the Complainant Finally about an hour later PRP investigators were informed that the Mustang had been seen striking the rear of a red Range Rover The female driver asked the driver of the Mustang – the Complainant – to follow her home to discuss the damage He did so However arriving at the woman’s address to find her husband at the bottom of the driveway inspecting the damage to the car the Complainant fled the area By the time of the last attempted carjacking PRP robbery investigators together with the SO and his team of officers were in their vehicles monitoring the movements of the Ford Mustang which had been seen to enter the City of Brampton At one point the Complainant stopped to let out a passenger in the rear seat before he made his way onto Torbram Road and travelled north As he approached Williams Parkway the Complainant turned into the Petro Canada gas station at the southeast corner of the intersection and stopped his vehicle at the northern most gas pump just west of the cashier’s kiosk The SO was the passenger in a Ford Expedition SUV being driven by WO 7 The officer conferred with the lead PRP detective in charge of their robbery investigation and decided they would attempt to stop the vehicle and arrest its occupants at this time He called the takedown signal The time was about 7:45 p.m The Ford Expedition entered the gas station lot from Torbram Road travelled around the east side of the cashier’s kiosk and drove up to the front passenger side of the Mustang bumping it as it came to a stop The SO exited through the Expedition’s passenger door gun in hand and pointed at the Mustang just as a Ford F350 pickup truck with WO 1 and WO 8 aboard pulled up and stopped front first at a 90-degree angle with the Mustang in front of the driver’s front corner of the vehicle At the sight of the SO and the vehicles surrounding his Mustang the Complainant accelerated in reverse trying to evade the blockade The Mustang did not get very far though as it struck the rear of a civilian SUV which had stopped for gas at the southern pump At about the same time the SO was making his way across the front of the Mustang handgun still pointed at the Complainant and yelling out at the driver to stop the vehicle The officer had noticed another civilian vehicle on the opposite side of the gas pump and was headed in that direction concerned that the Complainant might attempt to steal it to make good his escape After striking the vehicle behind him the Complainant accelerated and travelled forward in a northwest direction toward the SO As the officer moved to his right to avoid the vehicle he discharged his firearm three times in quick succession at the direction of the Complainant The final shot occurred around the time that the Complainant’s vehicle made contact with the SO and sent him to the ground The Ford F350 moved up a short distance and collided with the Mustang’s front end With the Mustang now at a standstill WO 1 exiting the passenger door of the F350 with a C8 rifle in hand and WO 6 the latter a dog handler who was part of the operation and had driven into the gas station lot bringing his vehicle to a stop south of the cashier kiosk approached the driver’s door and ordered the Complainant out of the vehicle When the Complainant failed to do so and instead continued to rev his engine WO 6 lifted his police dog and placed him inside the vehicle through the shattered driver’s door window The dog bit into the Complainant’s left upper arm  shoulder area and held on Shortly thereafter WO 6 discharged his CEW at the Complainant as did WO 1 This was followed by two punches to the Complainant head by WO 6 after which the officers extricated the Complainant from the Mustang and placed him on the ground The dog still with a hold of the Complainant as he exited the Mustang was released by WO 6 The Complainant was subsequently handcuffed As the Complainant’s was being arrested so too was his front seat passenger CW 1 CW 1 was removed from the Mustang by WO 7 and WO 8 Once CW 1 was on the ground and handcuffed WO 8 noticed a gun next to the front passenger seat of the Mustang Upon examination it was learned that the gun was an air pistol The three shots fired by the SO struck the Mustang One of them struck the driver’s side hood of the vehicle another struck the driver’s side lower corner of the windshield and the final shot impacted the driver’s door slightly below its top edge Only one of the bullets fired by the SO struck the Complainant The projectile entered the Complainant’s right arm n,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  Where the force in question was intended or likely to cause grievous bodily harm or death, section 25(3) further provides that such force will not be justified unless the officer reasonably believed it was necessary to prevent grievous bodily harm or death coming to the officer or a person under the officer’s charge.  I am unable to reasonably conclude on the evidence that theSOacted without the legal justification of this section when he discharged his firearm at the Complainant.TheSOwas in the execution of his lawful duties when he took part in a police operation to stop the Mustang in the gas station and arrest its occupants.  ThePRProbbery investigators had briefed theSOand his tactical team, informing them of the carjacking and attempted carjackings that had occurred that date involving the Mustang and the Complainant.  They were also apprised of the string of violent carjackings in which the Complainant had been involved in the weeks prior to the takedown involving the use of guns and knives to intimidate and assault victims.  On this record, and having personallyviewed the video recording captured by aYRPhelicopter camera as it surveilled the Complainant and his Mustang on the day in question, there is little doubt that the Complainant was subject to arrest for any number of violent offences.TheSOsays that he fired at the driver of the vehicle believing it was necessary to protect himself from being run over as the Mustang accelerated in his direction.  The circumstantial evidence bears him out.  As was vividly recorded by a gas station camera, from the moment theSOexited the Ford Expedition until he discharged his weapon at the Complainant, not more than ten seconds had elapsed.  During this time, the Complainant had given every indication that he was not about to surrender peacefully.  Instead, the Complainant accelerated rearward and struck a vehicle behind him, almost hitting a male who was fueling theSUV.  As theSOthen made his way across the front of the Mustang toward its driver’s side, gun pointed at the Complainant and shouting at him to stop, the Complainant accelerated forward aggressively in the officer’s direction.  In fact, the Mustang’s front and rear driver’s side tires jumped the curb of the platform housing the gas pump before its forward movement was stalled when it collided with the front passenger corner of the F350.  It was during this time, as theSOmaneuvered to his right to avoid the Mustang traveling in his direction, that the officer fired his weapon at close range.  On this record, confronted by a vehicle bearing down on him from which he was not more than two to three metres at the moment of gunfire, I am satisfied that theSOreasonably believed that shooting at the driver and incapacitating the Mustang’s operating mind was necessary if he was going to preserve himself from death.Taking a step back, I am also satisfied that theSOcomported himself reasonably in the moments that preceded the shooting.  The officer had good reason to exit his vehicle with his firearm drawn.  TheSOand the rest of the tactical officers had been briefed on the violence with which the carjackings had been executed, which included the use of guns and knives to threaten and assault the victims.  In fact, an air gun was recovered from the Mustang after the Complainant andCW#1 had been arrested.  The officer also had cause to believe that the Complainant, in trying to escape police apprehension, might exit the Mustang and enter a vehicle stopped on the opposite side of the pump.  Thus, I am unable to fault the officer for making his way in that direction to foreclose that possibility even though it meant placing himself in the Mustang’s path of travel.TheCEWdischarges, the use of the police dog, and the two punches delivered byWO#6, in my view, also did not run afoul of the limits of reasonably necessary force.  To reiterate, the officers had information that the occupants of the Mustang were likely armed with a gun and had shown a disposition to brandish weapons in violent assaults on carjacking victims.  When, as the evidence suggests, the Complainant continued to rev his engine even after he was shot, the officers were entitled to resort to a measure of force to subdue him and control his movements.  In the fraught atmosphere that existed at the time, I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that this use of force crossed the line.  This is particularly so as the weight of the evidence indicates theCEWdischarges and dog bite failed to deter the Complainant, whose resistance was only quelled after the two punches delivered byWO#6.In the result, as I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that theSOand the other officers who participated in the operation that resulted in the Complainant’s arrest conducted themselves lawfully throughout the incident, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Ontario Provincial Police,,Ontario,The CW was fortunate to have escaped the collision without serious injury,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  Liability for the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked deviation from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances:R v Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49;R v Roy(2012), 281 CCC (3d) 433 (SCC).  In my view, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.TheSOwas in the lawful execution of his duty performing traffic enforcement when he ran a check on the Complainant’s licence plates and learned that they were unlawfully affixed to the vehicle.  Wishing to confirm he had correctly recorded the licence marker, theSOacted reasonably in accelerating after the Complainant’s vehicle to close the distance.  It is true that theSOreached speeds upwards of 160 km/h as he travelled southward on Newport Road but his speed as such transpired over a matter of seconds and was not without cause given the fact that the Complainant was himself accelerating away from the officer at the time.  Moreover, given theGPSdata suggesting that theSOslowed to an extent as he came upon the stop sign at Old Greenfield Road, the little to no traffic on the roadway at the time, the rural setting and the favourable environmental conditions, I am satisfied that theSOhad due regard for public safety as he drove after the Complainant.There is some evidence that the Complainant was pushed by theSOinto operating his vehicle in a dangerous fashion.  Specifically, this evidence indicates that the Complainant’s vehicle failed to stop at the Old Greenfield Road stop sign because theSOwas right on its tail and the vehicle could not stop without a possible collision with the cruiser.  In addition, this evidence indicates that theSOeven pulled up alongside the driver and passenger side of the Complainant’s vehicle as they travelled south of Old Greenfield Road, and that it may have been a bump by the cruiser that caused the vehicle to go into the ditch.While I am cognizant of the need to avoid weighing the strength of competing evidence beyond threshold considerations, I am satisfied that it would be unsafe and unwise to rest charges on the more inculpatory evidence without corroboration.   For example, this evidence also indicated that the engagement with the officer lasted about two to three minutes.  However, the forensic evidence establishes that theSOdrove south on Newport Road for no longer than about 24 seconds.  I appreciate that estimates of time may be mistaken in the context of highly dynamic events, but it seems to me that the inculpatory evidence is so faulty as to cast doubt on its credibility.  This evidence also indicates that theSOhad managed to position his cruiser alongside the driver and passenger side of the Complainant’s vehicle in the moments before he drove into the ditch.  The forensic evidence, however, strongly suggests that this sequence of events could not have occurred in that manner.  In similar vein, it is telling that this account was not supported by a civilian eyewitness.In his account of the incident, theSOwas well back of the Complainant’s vehicle, and in fact had lost sight of the vehicle as it travelled through the curve in the roadway only to see it again after it had flipped over and come to rest in the ditch.  There is nothing in the forensic evidence to cast doubt on his rendition of events.In the result, there are no reasonable grounds in the aforementioned-record to believe that theSO, in the context of an engagement that lasted no more than about 24 seconds and approximately one kilometre, comported himself other than in accordance with the criminal law.  Consequently, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against the officer, and the file is closed.Date:	December 21, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1021
,Ontario Provincial Police,Brighton,Ontario,The Complainant was diagnosed as having suffered “a grade 3 acromioclavicular joint separation”,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was a want of care on the part of  theSOthat caused or contributed to the collision and was sufficiently egregious to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.While I am satisfied on the evidence that theSOis responsible for the collision, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officer transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  There is no indication in the evidence of any unlawful or reckless behaviour on the part of the Complainant as he cycled eastward in the bike path on Lighthouse Lane. Rather, it appears that the officer, perhaps owing to the speed differential between the bike and cruiser – the former was traveling faster – simply failed to ensure that his way was clear and that he could complete his turn in safety before embarking on the turn.  That said, there was no other indicia of dangerous driving on the part of theSOin and around the time of the collision.  To reiterate, he had been traveling at slow speed at the time – between about 20 to 25 km/h.  In the circumstances, theSO’s indiscretion amounts to a momentary lapse of care, which is not enough to render his conduct a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds in the evidence to believe that theSOcomported himself in breach of the criminal law, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges and the file is closed.Date:	April 26, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1311

The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.On the contrary, in the moments before the accident, it appears that theSOdrove his cruiser with due regard for the safety of the public around him.  It is worth noting, for starters, that the officer was in the lawful execution of his duty at the time as he was responding to a call for service involving a barricaded person.  As such, pursuant to section 144(20) of theHighway Traffic Act, theSOwas entitled to travel through a red light but only when it was safe to do so after first coming to a full stop.  The evidence establishes that the officer did in fact come to a full stop and that it was only after eastbound traffic had safely cleared that he proceeded into the intersection.  He did so slowly and with his emergency lights operating. Seeing the Complainant approaching westward from the east in the curb lane of Williams Parkway, and not slowing down or stopping, theSOwatched as the motorcyclist lost control of his vehicle and fell onto his right side.  There is a suggestion in the evidence that theSOmight have sounded his airhorn shortly after seeing the motorcycle, startling the Complainant and causing his loss of control.  Be that as it may, I am unable to fault the officer for sounding equipment in an attempt to alert the motorcyclist to his presence in the intersection.On the aforementioned-record, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOcomported himself lawfully as he drove into the intersection moments before the Complainant’s crash.

,Peel Regional Police,Grey,Ontario,Choudry’s abdomen and his right elbow was fractured,"The two overarching questions with respect to the potential criminal liability of the involved officers are whether theSO,WO#2 andWO#8 used excessive force during their interaction with Mr. Choudry, and whetherWO#10 was criminally negligent as the officer in charge of the police response.  Following a thorough examination of the evidence, I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe anyPRPofficer committed a criminal offence in relation to Mr. Choudry’s death.To begin, I will consider whether theSO,WO#2 andWO#8 used excessive force. Subsections 25(1) and 25(3) of theCriminal Codedictate when police officers are permitted to use force, including lethal force.  Section 25(1) states that a police officer is justified, if he or she acts on reasonable grounds, in using as much force as necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Section 25(3) clarifies that a police officer is only permitted to use force likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm if the officer believes on reasonable grounds that lethal force is necessary to preserve themselves or others from death or grievous bodily harm.I accept that thePRPofficers were acting within the execution of their lawful duties when they accompanied paramedics to Mr. Choudry’s apartment and breached the balcony door.   Police officers are bound by a duty to protect life, which extends to the general public and not just victims of crime.WO#1 andWO#4 were acting squarely within this duty by entering the unit to retrieve Mr. Choudry’s pocket-knife and facilitate his assessment by paramedics.  Furthermore, theMental Health Actallows police officers to take an individual into custody for psychiatric examination if certain conditions are met and they have reasonable grounds to believe the individual is suffering from an apparent mental disorder that likely will result in serious harm to the person or another person.  The police knew Mr. Choudry suffered from schizophrenia, had potentially absconded from psychiatric care and was not taking his medication.  I accept that, when Mr. Choudry brandished the knife in the presence of police and refused to cooperate, the police had adequate grounds to apprehend him because he presented a threat to himself or others and demonstrated a lack of competence to care for himself.  Finally, while Mr. Choudry effectively told the police to get a warrant, a warrant was not necessary for the police to lawfully enter the apartment.  Apart from the likelihood that the police had implicit permission from the family to enter the unit, police are allowed warrantless entry into apartments to check on an individual’s well-being when there are exigent circumstances.[12]The only direct evidence of what transpired in the apartment preceding the officers’ use of force comes fromWO#2 andWO#8. After the balcony door was breached, bothWO#2 andWO#8 observed Mr. Choudry standing in the living room holding a large kitchen knife in his right hand.  According to the officers, Mr. Choudry had the knife extended towards the officers and immediately began moving in their direction.  The officers commanded him to drop the knife to no avail andWO#8 deployed hisCEWtowards Mr. Choudry.  The officer believed theCEWconnected with Mr. Choudry’s torso but had no apparent effect.[13]At about the same time, as Mr. Choudry continued to move towards the balcony door,WO#2 aimed towards Mr. Choudry’s arm and discharged hisARWENthree times.WO#2 estimated that Mr. Choudry was about eight feet away when he discharged theARWEN.WO#8 estimated that Mr. Choudry was five to six feet from the threshold of the door when this occurred.  Both officers reported that Mr. Choudry was undeterred by theARWENdischarges and continued moving towards the officers.WO#8 estimated that Mr. Choudry was about three feet from the balcony door, and five to six feet from theSO, when theSOdischarged his pistol twice at Mr. Choudry.WO#2 estimated Mr. Choudry was four feet away from the door at the time of the shooting.After the shooting,WO#2 andWO#8 described Mr. Choudry taking a couple steps back into the apartment and falling to the ground near a couch.  According to the officers, he used his left arm to prop himself up and still had the knife held in his right hand.  The officers moved into the apartment and yelled at Mr. Choudry to drop the knife.WO#2 shot at Mr. Choudry two more times with theARWEN.  With theARWENout of rubber bullets,WO#8 kicked Mr. Choudry’s arm with all his strength, causing him to drop the knife.  Mr. Choudry eased himself onto his back andWO#2 immediately rendered first aid.A video of the balcony suggests that about eight to nine seconds elapsed from the moment the officers breached the balcony door to the moment Mr. Choudry was shot, and about another six seconds elapsed beforeWO#2 fired the final ARWEN shot.[14]Following the death of Mr. Choudry, it was suggested that Mr. Choudry was not capable of approaching the officers as described due to his poor health.  TheSIUgathered evidence from the Choudry family and Mr. Choudry’s physician which confirmed that Mr. Choudry was frail, unable to walk at the speed of an average adult and would need to take breaks after walking even short distances.   However,WO#2 andWO#8 did not suggest that Mr. Choudry walked a great distance.  Instead, they both described him moving a matter of feet during the interaction which occurred over about nine seconds.  There was also evidence that Mr. Choudry would use walls or the furniture to support himself while moving around the apartment, but it does not appear that Mr. Choudry was incapable of walking unsupported.  Mr. Choudry could walk without a cane or a walker and was known to walk occasionally to a nearby mall, albeit slowly and with frequent breaks.  Based on evidence about Mr. Choudry’s medical condition, I am not persuaded he was unable to walk as described.  As such, evidence of Mr. Choudry’s frailty alone is not enough to cast doubt on the accounts ofWO#2 andWO#8.WO#2 andWO#8’s descriptions of what occurred inside the apartment otherwise appear both credible and reliable.  It is believable that Mr. Choudry, who had paranoid beliefs about the police, would approach the officers with a knife in order to protect himself, especially when he had already brandished a knife at officers earlier that evening.  The officers’ statements were also primarily consistent both internally and with each other, and partially corroborated on important points by objective and forensic evidence.  For example, the video recording of the balcony confirms the officers commanded Mr. Choudry to drop the knife after breaching the door and after entering the apartment.  The video also corroborates the officers’ description of the timing and nature of the force used on Mr. Choudry.  The forensic evidence is similarly consistent with the officers’ description of Mr. Choudry approaching the officers when he was shot:  aCEWprobe was found lodged in Mr. Choudry’s abdomen and the trajectory of the two bullet wounds was from the front to the back, and slightly downwards.  The pathologist also noted a fracture to Mr. Choudry’s right elbow, which might have been caused byWO#8’s forceful kick.  Lastly, the knife found at the scene was similar to the one described by the officers.On these facts, I find that theSOwas justified pursuant to subsections 25(1) and 25(3) of theCriminal Codein using lethal force against Mr. Choudry.  While I have no evidence from theSOabout his state of mind,WO#11 heard theSOsay, “I had to do it, I had no choice,” immediately after the shooting.  I am also able to infer from the circumstances that theSOheld the subjective belief that he was required to use his firearm to protect himself and his partners from serious harm.  Despite his frailty, Mr. Choudry was armed with an edged weapon, a kitchen knife with a 20-centimetre blade, which could cause grievous injury or death.  At the time of the shooting, lesser use of force, including use of aCEWand multipleARWENdischarges, had failed to deter Mr. Choudry.  Indeed, Mr. Choudry had moved within approximately three to four feet of the balcony doorway (about five to six feet from theSO) and had shown no intention of stopping before theSOdischarged his weapon.  There was no realistic way to retreat because the officers were perched on a small, crowded balcony they could only exit by using ladders.  There was also no time to switch tactics and try other methods, such as using oleoresin capsicum spray or a baton, to disarm Mr. Choudry. Any other option to respond to the threat, such as going hands-on with Mr. Choudry or closing the balcony door (which swung into the apartment), would have increased the risk that the officers would suffer serious injury or death.  As such, I believe theSO’s resort to his firearm was objectively reasonable, necessary and proportional to the threat posed by Mr. Choudry, notwithstanding the tragic loss of life it caused.Having found theSOresort to lethal force justified on the balcony, I accordingly find thatWO#2’s andWO#8’s use of theCEWandARWENon the balcony was similarly justified.  Had these options caused Mr. Choudry to drop the knife, there would have been no need for theSOto use his firearm and the officers might have safely apprehended Mr. Choudry.  I similarly cannot faultWO#8 for kicking Mr. Choudry’s arm to disarm him inside the apartment.  What is more troubling is whether the use of theARWENafter Mr. Choudry fell to the ground was justified.The post-mortem report suggests that Mr. Choudry was shot with anARWENin his mid-back and I believe this likely occurred while Mr. Choudry was on the ground.[15]At first blush, this use of force is questionable given Mr. Choudry’s frailty and position on the floor; however, I am unable to find it excessive.  Mr. Choudry had shown determination in approaching the officers with a knife by advancing on them despite theCEWandARWENdischarges.  Even after he was shot, he continued to hold the knife, and also appeared to be using his left hand to try to get up.  In this context and considering the need to immediately disarm Mr. Choudry to provide him with life-saving medical attention, I am unable to find the finalARWENdischarges excessive.  In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, which provides that “police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection”.   The law is clear that police officers are not required to measure the force they use with exactitude or to a nicety.The second question is whether a police officer committed the offence of criminal negligence causing death contrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  Mr. Choudry’s tragic death is one of a series of recent deaths involving police responding to individuals in crisis.  In the wake of these deaths, there has been a call from families and the community to reform policing, including the way mental health crises are handled by first responders.   There have been concerns that police presence can escalate these situations and make them worse.  In Mr. Choudry’s case, his paranoia about police played a significant role in his death and these concerns have obvious validity.  While questions about police reform are of clear importance, systemic issues in policing can only play a role in theSIU’s decision-making where they are relevant to the potential criminal culpability of an individual police officer.  The offence of criminal negligence causing death is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  Notwithstanding the aforementioned-concerns, I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe that the responding officers’ conduct approached this level of negligence.  In fact, it appears the officer in charge,WO#10, made appropriate use of the available resources and reasonable choices in an ultimately failed attempt to safely apprehend Mr. Choudry.[16]Pursuant toPRPpolicy,WO#10 as the Duty Inspector was required to assume responsibility for the incident.WO#10’s responsibilities included directing the police response and requesting additional resources where necessary.   I am unable to find thatWO#10 executed any of these responsibilities in a manner that constituted a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable person.  To start, it appears thatWO#10 made appropriate use of the resources available.  ThePRPhas a Mobile Crisis Rapid Response Team (MCRRT) that consists of a police officer and a mental health professional.  WhenWO#10 took control of the call, he was aware theMCRRTwere unable to respond because they were busy at another incident.  He cannot be faulted for their unavailability.[17]Instead, theTRUteam took control of the scene.  TheTRUteam is a specialized unit responsible for barricaded person calls and its members have crisis negotiation training.WO#10 was aware that theTRUteam was negotiating with Mr. Choudry using a Punjabi-speaking officer to interpret.  He believed Mr. Choudry spoke some English but wanted to ensure there were no misunderstandings. When negotiations reached an impasse,WO#10 called in theCNT, a team of crisis negotiators that could act in an advisory fashion.  He also requested police contact the hospital where Mr. Choudry had been treated, speak with the family to learn about Mr. Choudry’s medical issues and seek advice from a mental health professional.As it is apparent that the presence of police was escalating Mr. Choudry’s behaviour,WO#10’s decision to not permit the family to speak with Mr. Choudry is open to legitimate scrutiny.  Mr. Choudry’s family had experience in calming Mr. Choudry and had helped facilitate his safe apprehension before.  However,WO#10 explained that using a third-party to negotiate was inherently risky.  For instance, using a loved one to negotiate with a person in crisis might prompt a dying declaration making the situation worse.   In the present case,WO#10 was also cognizant that the family members had been unable to de-escalate the situation earlier that evening.  In addition, a person without protective equipment (such as a family member, mental health professional or negotiator) would generally not have been placed near the apartment door when Mr. Choudry was armed with a knife. In the circumstances, the decision-making ofWO#10 or the other officers was not without reason in this regard.  In making this assessment, I am cognizant thatWO#9 spoke with Mr. Choudry about his family and said his brother wanted to speak with him.  In response, Mr. Choudry expressed frustration with his family and disinterest in speaking with his brother.A more difficult question is whetherWO#10 was criminally negligent in thePRP’s approach to apprehending Mr. Choudry.  I cannot find fault in the initial plan to contain Mr. Choudry, keep other tenants sheltered and try to negotiate Mr. Choudry’s safe surrender with an interpreter.  Instead, the real question is whether executing theDAPwas criminally negligent.  The police were aware that Mr. Choudry was afraid of police.  Moreover, there is the real possibility that Mr. Choudry was unable to understand the officers as they did not speak Punjabi. On the other hand, the hope was that the element of surprise would prevent Mr. Choudry from taking defensive action and that the use of multiple officers would mean there were more “less lethal” use of force options (such as aCEWorARWEN) to facilitate a safe apprehension should circumstances turn volatile.  In addition,WO#9 had already explained in Punjabi to Mr. Choudry the officers’ concerns about the knife.It is significant that theDAPwas not implemented until after Mr. Choudry became non-responsive and its necessity had crystalized.   The approximately 20-minute long period of non-responsiveness alarmedWO#10, who was worried that Mr. Choudry was at risk for self-harm.  Beyond that,WO#10 was concerned about Mr. Choudry’s physical condition.  He was of the understanding that Mr. Choudry was not taking his medication, had diabetes, a history of heart issues and recently had lung surgery.  He had been advised that Mr. Choudry could barely walk or breathe and was concerned Mr. Choudry’s breathing was exasperated by the heat of the day.  Faced with these concerns, and being unable to gain a visual on Mr. Choudry,[18]WO#10 was in a position where he had to weigh the risk of immediate intervention with the risk of not acting in the event Mr. Choudry was in medical distress.  While I acceptWO#10’s choice to intervene set in train a series of events with devastating consequences, I am unable to determine that this was a departure from what a reasonable person faced with the same choices would do, let alone a marked and substantial departure.In the final analysis, as I am not reasonably satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the shooting of Mr. Choudry amounted to legally unjustified force or was the culmination of a criminally negligent course of conduct, there is no basis to proceed with criminal charges in this case notwithstanding Mr. Choudry’s tragic death.

,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,A pathologist with the Ontario Coroner’s Office in Toronto conducted the post-mortem examinations of Complainant 1 and two of the children,"The offences that arise for consideration aredangerous driving causing bodily harmanddangerous driving causing deathcontrary to sections 320.13(2) and 320.13(3) of theCriminal Code, respectively. As offences of penal negligence, simple negligence will not suffice to ground liability. Rather, liability for the crimes is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances:R v Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49. I am satisfied that theSOdid not transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.There is, in my view, very little of which to be critical in the conduct of theSO. He did what one would expect of an officer in a marked cruiser patrolling the roadways who comes across a vehicle without a front licence plate; he intervened with the intention of investigating its driver for a potential traffic offence.As far as can be discerned, theSOdid so in a manner that was generally safe and prudent. There is, for example, no indication of any overly excessive speed on the part of theSOas he followed Complainant #5 north on Bramalea Road, east on Father Tobin Drive and then north on Sunny Meadow Boulevard. There were occasional bursts of acceleration during which theSOsignificantly exceeded the speed limit. The first transpired over a few seconds as theSOreached about 100 km/h while east on Father Tobin Drive. The second occurred as theSOturned to travel east on Countryside Drive from Sunny Meadow Boulevard after he had made the decision to stop Complainant #5. On this occasion, theSOreached and maintained speeds slightly over 100 km/h for about 300 metres and ten seconds. In both instances, theSOmade sure to activate his emergency lights in order to alert traffic in the vicinity of his speeds.Moreover, there is no indication that any third party was ever directly imperiled by theSO’s speeds, nor is there any suggestion that theSO’s conduct unduly fueled the Complainant’s reckless driving. On the contrary, the evidence establishes that theSOwas well-back of Complainant #5, having decided, reasonably in my view, to slow and discontinue his active pursuit some 300 metres from the site of the collision.The short-lived nature of theSO’s engagement and the environmental conditions at the time are also important mitigating factors. From the moment theSOperformed a U-turn and began to follow Complainant #5 until he disengaged in the area of Moldovan Drive, theSOhad travelled less than two-and-a-half kilometres in under two minutes. The roadways were dry and in good condition, the weather was clear, and traffic was unremarkable for that time and area.It must be noted that theSOdoes appear on theGPSdata to have driven through several stop signs without coming to a complete stop while tailing Complainant #5: twice on Father Tobin Drive at its intersections with Sherbrooke Street and Sunny Meadow Boulevard, and once on Sunny Meadow Boulevard while turning onto Countryside Drive. Section 136(1) of theHighway Traffic Actrequires that all motorists, police officers included, come to a complete stop at stop signs. TheSO’s failure to do so is disconcerting and, I am satisfied, created a danger on the roadway.In the final analysis, however, while theSOought to have come to a complete stop at the aforementioned stop signs, I am not satisfied that theSO’s indiscretions amounted to a marked departure from a reasonable level of care when weighed in the balance with the extenuating considerations outlined above. Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges against theSOand the file is closed.Date:	October 13, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=964
,Ontario Provincial Police,Bruce,Ontario,He has undergone multiple procedures to treat burn-related injuries,"The only offence that arises for consideration iscriminal negligence causing bodily harmcontrary to section 221 of theCriminal Code.  Liability for the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which theSOinteracted with the Complainant which caused or contributed to the Complainant’s injuries and was sufficiently derelict to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, the answer is clearly in the negative.TheSOwas engaged in the execution of his duties, namely, his foremost duty to protect and preserve life, when he responded to the scene of a person threatening suicide and attempted to prevent him from harming himself.  Though the Complainant had provided misleading information to the help line regarding his location, which was then passed on to the police, theSOwas on the scene within half-an-hour of being dispatched thanks to theOPPascertaining the whereabouts of the Complainant’s cell phone.Once at the scene, I am satisfied that theSOdid what he could to thwart the Complainant’s designs on hurting himself.  In reassuring tones, the officer explained that he was there to help the Complainant.  He did not push the situation and stayed well back of the van at the Complainant’s request.  As negotiations were ongoing with the Complainant, theSOasked that firefighters and paramedics making their way to the area did so without their sirens blaring so as not to provoke the Complainant.  Regrettably, the Complainant could not be deterred.  Some 30 minutes after theSOhad arrived, he set his van ablaze with himself in it.  Even then, theSOand his partner, also present for most of the negotiation, rushed to the burning vehicle to render assistance.  They considered forcing their way into the van but were composed enough to realize that a free flow of air into the vehicle might do more to feed the fire.  They refrained from doing so, wisely in my view, and instead waited for the firefighters to arrive.  Within minutes of the firefighters’ arrival, the blaze was put out and the Complainant removed from the vehicle.On the aforementioned-record, it is plain that theSOacted within the limits of the law throughout his interaction with the Complainant.  In fact, the overall police operation, and theSO’s part within it, are probably responsible for ensuring that the Complainant did not die that day.  Accordingly, there being no basis to proceed with criminal charges in this case, the file is closed.Date:	February 16, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1126
,Toronto Police Service,Markham,Ontario,Complainant 1 suffered a fractured hand while one of her daughters Complainant 2 broke her clavicle,"The only offence that arises for consideration as far as the potential criminal liability of the subject officer is concerned isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code. As an offence of penal negligence, liability for the crime is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances:R v Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49;R v Roy(2012), 281 CCC (3d) 433 (SCC).I am satisfied that theSOcomported himself within the limits of the law in the course of his brief engagement withCW#3’s vehicle. TheSOwas within his rights to initiate a pursuit ofCW#3 having seen him dangerously blow through a red light at speed in the opposing lanes of traffic. Thereafter, there is no indication in the evidence that theSOdrove dangerously. With his emergency lights and siren activated, he safely proceeded through the intersection that marked the beginning of the engagement. While theSOdid exceed the speed limit as he chased afterCW#3, averaging about 73 km/h from start to finish, there was no other traffic in the southbound lanes, nor was northbound vehicular traffic impacted in any way. The officers used their emergency equipment judiciously throughout the incident keeping their emergency lights on at all times and activating their siren as they approached intersections. Finally, there is no suggestion that theSOunduly pushedCW#3. In fact, theSOwas at all times well back ofCW#3, who had ample opportunity to desist in his reckless driving had he been so inclined.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds on the aforementioned-record to believethat theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against the officer and the file is closed.Date:	November 30, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1051
,Halton Regional Police Service,Brant,Ontario,The Complainant was taken from the scene to hospital where he was diagnosed and treated for a dislocated left hip and fractured left leg,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  Liability for the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  In my view, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.TheSOwas engaged in the lawful discharge of his duty at the time of the incident.  Having run a licence check on the Chrysler and learned that the plates were stolen, the officer did what one would expect an officer to do – he followed the Chrysler intending to pull it over for further investigation.I am further satisfied that theSOoperated his cruiser reasonably and with due regard for public safety, including the safety of the Chrysler’s occupants, as he followed the vehicle on Havendale Road.  TheAVL/GPSdata and video evidence indicate that this was a slow speed engagement; both the cruiser and the Chrysler were travelling in and around the speed limit the entire time.  Moreover, theSOused his emergency lights to warn motorists and pedestrians in the area, of which there were little to none at that time of day, and kept a safe distance behind the Chrysler.  While it may be that theSOdrove past two stop signs that were along the route without fully stopping, his indiscretions, if they be such, did not endanger anyone in the neighbourhood given the late hour.  Finally, it is worth noting that the environmental conditions were favourable at the time: the weather was clear and the roadway was dry.In the result, while the driver of the Chrysler entered into the park in an attempt to flee from police, thereby resulting in the accident that injured the Complainant, I have no doubt that theSOcomported himself within the limits of the criminal law throughout the brief pursuit.

,York Regional Police,Aurora,Ontario,r\n\nCause of Death nThe pathologist at autopsy was unable to ascertain the cause of the Complainant’s death with any certainty,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  By the time of the physical confrontation,SO#1 had decided to apprehend the Complainant under section 17 of theMental Health Act. The Complainant had been diagnosed with a psychiatric  disorder and was acting strangely on the day in question, prompting a call to police from his wife who was concerned about her family’s safety.  Once at the house,SO#1 saw for himself the signs of disconcerting behaviour coming from the Complainant, including a pile of latex gloves that the Complainant had just burned inside the home for no apparent reason.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied thatSO#1 was within his rights in seeking to apprehend the Complainant under theMental Health Act.Thereafter, I am satisfied that the force used bySO#1 andSO#2, who joined in the effort to apprehend the Complainant minutes after the altercation started, was lawful.  While it is clear thatSO#1 delivered many strikes to the Complainant as they fought on the floor, inflicting a series of lacerations, abrasions and bruises, it is also apparent that the Complainant battled the officer strenuously throughout the interaction, attempting to choke him on several occasions.  The Complainant was a big and powerful man, and proved a formidable challenge even after the arrival of two additional officers.  It was only with the deployment of theCEWbySO#2 that the Complainant was subdued and the officers able to handcuff him.  The discharge itself, as data downloaded from the weapon show, lasted no more than a second.  On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the overall force used by the officers was disproportionate, excessive or unreasonable.In arriving at this conclusion, I am mindful of the pathologist’s findings at autopsy.  While unable to ascertain a definitive cause of death, the pathologist was of the view that it was possible the Complainant’s death arose from atherosclerotic coronary disease, excited delirium syndrome or a combination of both.  The pathologist further indicated that the use of aCEWwas unlikely to have caused death, and that the bruising, abrasions and lacerations on the Complainant’s person were not serious injuries and were unrelated to the death.It is apparent that the Complainant was of unsound mind at the time of these unfortunate events.  He had struggled with his mental health for a period and even been hospitalized on at least one prior occasion.SO#1 was aware that the Complainant had a history of mental illness and did what he could in their initial encounter to avoid causing the Complainant any further distress, this while knowing that he would have to take the Complainant into custody under theMental Health Actgiven the family’s concerns and fears.  His initial overtures were non-aggressive.  He introduced himself to the Complainant by assuring him he was there to check on his well-being and not for any law enforcement action.  It wasSO#1’s intention to buy time with the Complainant to allow other officers to arrive at the address, which, had that occurred, may have resulted in a less violent apprehension.  Regrettably, the officer’s hand was forced when the Complainant lashed out physically at the officer prior to the other officers’ arrival.  Be that as it may, as I am satisfied thatSO#1 andSO#2conducted themselves lawfully throughout their encounter with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges and the file is closed.Date:	March 1, 2021Joseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1142
,Hanover Police Service,Durham,Ontario,The Complainant was ultimately diagnosed with two rib fractures and a left-sided hemothorax,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.  While the lawfulness of the Complainant’s arrest, aside from any questions regarding the propriety of the force that was used by the officers, is clouded to an extent by conflicts in the evidence, I am unable to reasonably conclude with any confidence that the officers were without lawful grounds to seek to arrest the Complainant.  There is a version of events proffered in the evidence thatCW#7 and the Complainant were standing by theSO’s cruiser yelling at him through the closed driver’s door when the officer exited, grabbed hold ofCW#7 and slammed him into the side of the vehicle.  Thereafter, the Complainant came to his son’s aid and was met with aCEWdischarge and baton strikes.  On this  version of events, a case can be made that the Complainant had a right to intervene to defend his son from an unlawful attack, and that the force used against him (the Complainant) was unlawful.The evidence strongly suggests, however, that this  account of what occurred was materially incomplete.  First and foremost, it does not acknowledge any force that may have been used against the officers by either ofCW#7 or the Complainant.  The evidence establishes, in my view, that the Complainant kicked the officers in the course of the fracas.    For these and other reasons, I am not satisfied that the evidence in its totality is sufficiently cogent to reasonably establish thatCW#7’s arrest was, per se, unlawful.  If it was not, then the Complainant had no legal standing to interfere with it; when he did, he too was subject to being arrested for assaulting a police officer.  The issue turns to the propriety of the force used by the officers in aid of the Complainant’s arrest.Here, too, there is insufficiently reliable evidence to reasonably believe that either of theSOandWO#6 used excessive force in their arrest of the Complainant.  It is clear that theSOdischarged hisCEWtwice about 15 seconds apart; the first, directed atCW#7, the second, at the Complainant.  It is also apparent that the officers, in the course of the physical struggle, used their batons to deliver strikes toCW#7 and the Complainant, though the precise number of strikes remains uncertain.  There is evidence from a number of witnesses that theCEWdischarges and baton strikes were gratuitous, but that evidence is severely undercut by the fact that the Complainant repeatedly kicked at the officers, including theSO’s head, which is established, in my view, on the clear weight of the evidence.  That being the case, all that can be said with any certainty is that the officers’ resort to force occurred in the context of what appears to have been a strenuous struggle between theSOandWO#6, on the one hand, andCW#7 and the Complainant , in which both sides delivered and received blows.  On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officers acted out of proportion to the challenges at hand.In the result, as I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOorWO#6 acted other than lawfully during their encounter with the Complainant, notwithstanding the serious injuries that were inflicted on the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

He had clocked the Complainant well over the posted speed – 104 km/h in a 60 km/h zone. Thereafter, there is nothing to indicate any want of care on the part of theSO. As soon as the Complainant made it clear he was not prepared to stop for theSOand sped away, theSOdecided, prudently in my view, that pursuing the Complainant was not worth the risk. While theSOdid briefly reach an average speed upwards of 100 km/h as he accelerated to catch up with the motorcyclists, there is no indication that any motorists in the vicinity were placed at undue risk by the officer. Finally, it is worth noting that the roadways were dry and the weather was clear. On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOconducted himself other than professionally and with due regard for the safety of the roadway users, including the Complainant and his associate.Regrettably, the Complainant continued at speed an additional two kilometres eastward on Lakeshore Boulevard West after theSOhad stopped following him, entered the intersection with Lower Simcoe Street against a red light and caused a serious collision. Be that as it may, I am satisfied that theSO– in the course of a brief engagement with the Complainant of under one kilometre – did not cause or contribute to the Complainant’s reckless drivingand the resultant collision in any fashion that attracts criminal sanction. Accordingly, there is no basis for criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	September 14, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=943

,Ontario Provincial Police,Grey,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital from the scene and diagnosed with a fracture to the left humerus,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.[4]Liability for the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances: R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49; R. v. Roy, [2012] 2 SCR 60. Though there are aspects of theSO’s driving that are open to legitimate scrutiny, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that the officer transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.TheSOwas within his rights to seek to stop the Civic for a speeding infraction after he had clocked it traveling 152 km/h on his radar device. As the officer entered onto Highway 401, he made judicious use of his emergency lights to clear traffic ahead of him while closing the distance with the Civic. He continued to make use of his emergency lights as the pursuit entered onto Highway 33. Between about two and two-and-a-half kilometres after taking the Stockdale Road exit at the roundabout, theSOended his pursuit of the Civic. Having observed the Civic disregard stop signs and recklessly overtake traffic, the decision was a wise one. Regrettably, the operator of the Civic did not respond in kind and continued in dangerous fashion upwards of an additional kilometre north on Stockdale Road until the collision.During the pursuit, theSOdid engage in conduct that could arguably be characterized as dangerous. For example, theGPSdata show that theSOreached a top speed upwards of 160 km/h on Highway 401 and then again for a period while northbound on Stockdale Road. The speeds on Highway 33, in and around 100 km/h for periods of time, were also well in excess of the speed limit. TheSOtravelled the wrong way for a distance on the Highway 401 eastbound on-ramp from Highway 33 and then again while overtaking a vehicle as he attempted to keep up with the Civic. Finally, theSOought to have communicated what was happening to his communications centre more so than he did. Such communication, required by police policy, is intended to place a senior officer in a position to make informed decisions with respect to whether the pursuit should continue or not. Aside from a communication made on Stockdale Road shortly before theSOstopped, in which theSOannounced his direction of travel and that he was attempting to catch up to a vehicle, the officer had made no prior radio transmissions about the pursuit.These instances of objectively risky behaviour, however, must be weighed in context. TheSOwas engaged in the execution of his duty and therefore presumptively exempt from the speed limitations pursuant to section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act. While the provision does not provide officers carte blanche to speed as they wish without regard for public safety, it does confer a measure of immunity on officers who in good faith find it necessary to exceed the speed limit in the discharge of their duties. The speeds achieved on Highway 401 were also, to an extent, the necessary by-product of having to catch up with the Civic, which was well past theSO’s location by the time he decided to pull it over.The dangers associated with theSO’s speeds throughout the pursuit, as with theSO’s decision to travel the wrong way for periods, were further mitigated by theSO’s use of his emergency lights over what was a relatively brief engagement in time and distance. This is not the case of aSOwith ample time failing to appreciate a clear and obvious risk until it was too late. On the contrary, it would appear theSOtook timely action to discontinue the pursuit about three kilometres after the vehicles had exited the highway. During this time, there is no indication of any civilian vehicle having to take abrupt evasive action to avoid the cruiser. In fact, it seems some motorists, alerted to the cruiser’s emergency lights, were able to safely pull their vehicles over and out of the way.Finally, there is no suggestion that theSOpushed or unduly fueled the Civic’s reckless operation in the penultimate stages of the pursuit. To reiterate, theSOhad terminated the pursuit and was well back of the Civic when the collision occurred. The driver of the Civic had plenty of time to adjust his dangerous driving ahead of the collision had he been so inclined.In the result, I am not persuaded on reasonable grounds that the manner in which theSOoperated his cruiser amounted to a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances. TheSOought to have kept his communications centre apprised of what he was doing, but failed to adequately do so. He also reached incredibly high speeds and drove for short stretches the wrong way, placing the traveling public around him at some risk but not in a manner that unduly imperiled public safety. Finally, theSOprudently decided to end his engagement with the Civic more than a kilometre from the site of the collision. On this record, in the course of a pursuit conducted in good weather and dry roads, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOdrove dangerously in violation of the criminal law. Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	November 23, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1004

The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.The speeds attained by theSOare a cause for concern. At close to 150 km/h, her maximum speed was three times the speed limit. In my view, as fast as she was traveling, theSO’s cruiser represented a danger on the roadway. That said, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO’s speed amounted to a marked deviation from a reasonable standard of care in the circumstances.Aside from theSO’s speed, there is little on the record to criticize of the manner in which the officer operated her cruiser during her brief engagement with the pickup truck. There is, for example, no evidence that she disregarded traffic control signals or directly imperiled any third parties in the vicinity. Moreover, theSOappears to have activated her emergency lights from an early point and attempted, in the brief time she had available, to keep her communication centre informed of what she was doing. While the roadway was lined with a mix of residential and business premises, it appears that traffic was relatively light at the time. The roadway was dry and in good condition. Finally, as theSOwas well back of the pickup truck – at least seven seconds behind – as it approached the intersection and collision site, there is no suggestion that theSOwas so close as to prevent the pickup driver from operating the vehicle in a safe fashion.TheSO’s speed is further mitigated by section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act, which exempts police officers in the lawful performance of their duties from speed limitations. While not providing free rein to police officers to speed as they wish without regard to public safety, I accept that theSOpresumptively fell within the four corners of the provision. Given the information she had been provided byWO#1 over the radio, and her personal observations of the pickup truck and the manner in which it accelerated away from her, she had cause to believe the vehicle was stolen, and was within her rights in initiating a pursuit under O Reg 266/10.On the aforementioned record, weighed in the context of what was a very brief pursuit and against the extenuating circumstances, I am satisfied that theSO’s speed did not transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

,London Police Service,London,Ontario,r\n\nCause of Death nAt autopsy the pathologist was of the preliminary view that the Complainant’s death was the result of multiple trauma as a consequence of a descent from height,"The offence that arises for consideration iscriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code. Liability for the crime is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances. In the instant case, the question is essentially this: did the involved officers contribute to the Complainant’s fall via a want of care that was so derelict as to attract criminal sanction? In my view, they did not.At the outset, I accept that the officers were engaged in the lawful execution of their duty, namely, their foremost duty to protect and preserve life, when they responded toCW#1’s residence to check on the Complainant’s well-being.CW#1 had called the police requesting their assistance with her son. His behaviour was odd and erratic, andCW#1 was hopeful the police could secure mental health supports for the Complainant. The police operator who tookCW#1’s call was unable to ascertain whether the Complainant was in a mental health crisis but explained that officers would be sent to assess the situation.Once in the hallway outsideCW#1’s door,WO#3 andWO#5, at first, followed byWO#1, theSO,WO#4 andWO#5, did what they could to engage the Complainant from behind a closed, and then partially closed, door. There was an opportunity shortly after the officers’ arrival to gain entry into the apartment.WO#5 pushed against the Complainant’s efforts to force the door closed, but decided to disengage in order to de-escalate the situation. In hindsight, that may have been a lost opportunity. That said, I am unable to fault the officers for making the decision they did at the time. They were unaware of the scope of the Complainant’s mental distress, and could reasonably surmise that forcing the issue at that moment might have resulted in more harm than good.The officers repeatedly attempted to communicate with the Complainant through the door. They spoke in reassuring tones in an effort to persuade him to come out. Participating in these efforts were a trained negotiator,WO#2, and theSO, who at one point was able to reach the Complainant on the phone and seemed to be making some progress in resolving the situation.When news arrived that the Complainant was perched on the balcony railing and threatening to jump, the officers escalated their response. A ram was used to force the door open, but was unsuccessful in creating an entry space sufficient to allow entry. An officer –WO#3 – was deployed to ground level to see what was happening on the balcony. He reported the Complainant sitting on the railing and then attempting to scale down the balconies. Within seconds, the Complainant fell from a balcony to the ground below, suffering mortal injuries in the process.It remains unclear why the officers on the scene did not enterCW#2’s apartment and her balcony to more closely interact with the Complainant. What is clear is that the Complainant was fearful of the police and had barricaded himself in the apartment once he learned of their presence in the hallway. In the circumstances, though they did not know it at the time, it was entirely possible that a more proactive posture at the moment might well have unduly provoked the Complainant.In the final analysis, I am unable to conclude on the aforementioned-record that theSO, or any of the involved officers, transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law. In the short time they had available to deal with the situation, the officers acted with due regard for the Complainant’s health and safety. Might they have done more to mobilize mental health supports from the community? Perhaps, but their failure to do so is tempered by the speed with which events unfolded; from the moment of theSO’s arrival at the scene until the Complainant started his fateful climb down the building, approximately 18 minutes had elapsed. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the police response fell short of constituting a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances. Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	September 2, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=929

,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,There he attacked CW 9 with a knife causing serious injuries,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.  In the event of lethal force, section 25(3) further provides that such force is not justified unless the police officer believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to preserve herself or another person under her charge from death or grievous bodily harm.  I have no grounds to reasonably conclude that theSOfell afoul of these strictures in the force she used against the Complainant.TheSOwas acting in the discharge of her lawful duties when she made her way into the backyard of the address at Holden Crescent and confronted the Complainant.  The radio communications and witness information at the scene would have given her grounds to believe that the male who had fled from the scene of a nearby motor vehicle accident had assaulted a number of residents in the area and was hiding in the shed.  That male – the Complainant – was clearly subject to arrest.I am further satisfied that the force used by theSO– the three gunshots followed possibly by twoCEWdischarges – fell within the limits of legal justification.  The Complainant walked in theSO’s direction when he emerged from the shed holding a knife covered in blood.  ACEWdischarge by the officer’s colleague,WO#1, had failed to deter him, as had repeated verbal commands that he drop his weapon and stop his advance.  There can be no doubt that the Complainant was intent on doing harm to the officers with the knife.  When he was not using it to cut himself, the Complainant pointed it at theSOwhile yelling that theSOwould have to shoot him.  Retreat was not an option.  The Complainant had just attacked and seriously wounded three residents of the homes he had broken into, and represented a real and present danger toWO#1 and others in the vicinity.  On this record, I am satisfied that theSOacted to thwart an imminent threat to life and limb when she fired her gun three times at the Complainant as he neared to within two to three metres of her location.Following the shooting, the Complainant appears to have been subjected to a couple ofCEWdischarges by theSOfollowed by a series of additionalCEWdeployments byWO#4, the latter arriving in the backyard just prior to the shooting.[4]The evidence indicates that the Complainant remained active while he was on the ground attempting to get back on his feet.  In fact, he appears to have regained his footing briefly beforeWO#4 first discharged hisCEW.  At the time theSOfired herCEW, the Complainant was not yet handcuffed.  Though he had been dispossessed of the knife he had been holding, the officers could not be sure he was not further armed.  Indeed, following his arrest, a smaller paring knife was located on the lawn in the vicinity of where the Complainant had fallen.  In the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to characterize theSO’sCEWdischarges as excessive.  Until she could be assured that the Complainant no longer represented a threat, theSOwas within her rights, in my view, to keep him immobilized at a distance with the use of herCEW.The number of timesWO#4’sCEWwas discharged around the time of the incident – a total of 14 times over a period upwards of eight minutes – seems excessive at first blush.  However, that evidence, derived from the data downloaded from his weapon, is in marked conflict with the statements ofWO#4 and other officers arriving to assist in the Complainant’s arrest.  That is, while the witness accounts establish thatWO#4 discharged hisCEWmultiple times at the Complainant, he reportedly did so only until the Complainant was handcuffed – a period not more than about four minutes from the moment of the shooting.   Throughout this shorter period, the evidence indicates that the Complainant was on the ground and active throughout.  He kicked his legs, flailed his arms, kept trying to get up, and attempted to bite the officers.  Even after the Complainant had been handcuffed, paramedics arriving at the scene felt it necessary to sedate him before they could deal with his injuries and transport him to hospital.  Given the real possibility that a portion of the 14 discharges recorded byWO#4’s weapon were unintentional and/or inadvertent deployments which did not strike the Complainant, and the evidence of the Complainant’s movement on the ground for a period even after he had been shot, the evidence in my view falls short of reasonably establishing that the force used byWO#4 transgressed the limits prescribed by the criminal law.The Complainant was not of sound mind at the time of these harrowing events; he appears to have been suffering from a psychotic episode.  Be that as it may, I am satisfied that theSOacted reasonably to contend with the circumstances as they unfolded given the exigencies of the situation.  In the final analysis, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that she and the other officers involved in the Complainant’s apprehension acted other than lawfully, there is no basis for pursuing criminal charges in this case.

,Toronto Police Service,Grey,Ontario,r\n\nCause of Death\nA forensic pathologist attributed the Complainant’s death to “gunshot wounds to torso”,"Section 34 of theCriminal Codesets out the law of self-defence in Canada.  The provision provides that conduct that would otherwise amount to an offence is legally justified where it is intended to thwart a reasonably apprehended attack, actual or threatened, against oneself or another person.  In order to attract the protection of section 34, the conduct must also be reasonable in all the circumstances, including with reference to such considerations as the nature of the force or threat, the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force, and whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon.The evidence establishes that theSO’s conduct was justified in self-defence.  The officer was engaged in the execution of his duties when he responded to an urgent call of a male in the possession of a knife and handgun in the parking lot of the hotel just north of his location.  Arriving within seconds, theSOquickly spotted the Complainant’s BMW and positioned his cruiser so as to prevent its movement forward, a reasonable tactic given the risk of the Complainant fleeing the scene.  Thereafter, the officer exited his cruiser and was almost immediately confronted by the Complainant, who seemed intent on provoking a confrontation with police.  The Complainant was holding in his left hand a kitchen knife with a serrated blade about 15 centimetres in length, an object clearly capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death.  He also gave every indication of wanting to use it to harm theSO; despite repeated calls from theSOandWO#1 that he drop the knife, the Complainant persisted, quickly advancing on theSOwith knife in hand.  TheSObacktracked an extent and then fired his weapon three times when the Complainant neared to within about a metre.  At that distance, the officer had every reason to believe that his life was in imminent peril and that shooting the Complainant was necessary if he was going to protect himself from a knife attack.  In fact, though the officer did not provide a statement to theSIU, I am satisfied that theSOwas of that mindset; the circumstantial evidence is so compelling that it permits of no other reasonable inference.  With respect to the number of shots fired, given the rapidity of their discharge one after the other, and the evidence regarding the location of the wounds coupled withWO#1’s eyewitness account suggesting the Complainant was on his feet throughout the gunfire, there is no reason to believe that the nature and extent of the threat changed appreciably from shots one through three.It is unclear why the Complainant acted as he did in the course of these tragic events.  There was evidence gathered in the investigation that the Complainant suffered from mental illness suggesting, possibly, that he was of unsound mind at the time.  Be that as it may, theSOwould have had no knowledge of mental illness being a factor at play as he made his way to the scene and confronted the Complainant.  The entire interaction from start to finish was over in a matter of seconds.  In that brief period of time, given what he knew and was faced with, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOacted other than lawfully when he discharged his firearm.For the foregoing reasons, there are no grounds to proceed with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	February 4, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1067
,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,CW 4 and CW 5 had exited the Honda by this time but they were quickly apprehended and taken into custody neither having suffered a serious injury,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances; simple negligence is insufficient to give rise to liability.  In the instant case, the issue is whether theSO’s conduct demonstrated a want of care that contributed to the collision in question and / or was sufficiently egregious as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, those questions must be answered in the negative.TheSOwas in the lawful discharge of his duties when he began to follow the Honda and initiated a pursuit of the vehicle.  By that time, he had confirmed that the vehicle was stolen.I am also satisfied that theSO, once engaged with the Honda, comported himself with due regard for public safety.  As appears from the GPS data and the witness evidence, while the officer exceeded the speed limit over the course of the pursuit as it travelled toward North Park Drive, there is no indication that those margins were markedly disproportionate to vehicular traffic in the area.  Nor is there any indication that theSOdisobeyed traffic control signals as he travelled the route.  Though theSOdid proceed past a community safety zone on Massey Street, there is no evidence of any third party having been manifestly endangered by the officer’s vehicle.The speeds reached on North Park Drive did constitute an objective danger on the roadway, but fell short of amounting to a marked deviation from a reasonable standard of care in the circumstances.  The area on North Park Drive had a school zone but was predominantly residential and governed by a 50 km/h speed limit.  At speeds well in excess of 100 km/h, at times over 120 km/h, I am satisfied that theSO’s vehicle created a tangible risk to public safety.  That risk, however, was tempered by the fuller context.  The officer was not simply pursuing the occupants of the Honda because they were in possession of a stolen vehicle.  Rather, he suspected that one of them was armed with a gun.  Though perhaps thinly-based on equivocal behaviour theSOhad observed, I am unable to dismiss the officer’s suspicions as simple pretext or wholly baseless.[1]Moreover, the officer had activated his emergency equipment and was traveling over dry roads in good repair at a time when it appears that traffic in the vicinity was light.  Again, there is no evidence of theSOhaving disregarded traffic control signals along North Park Drive, or other motorists or pedestrians having had to take evasive action to avoid a collision.  TheSO’s speed also occurred in under a minute over a stretch of roadway that was about a kilometre in length.  That is to say, the risk posed by the officer’s speed was relatively short-lived in time and distance.  Finally, while theSOwas within a few car lengths of the Honda when it attempted to turn onto Torbram Road and struck a vehicle in the intersection, the evidence establishes that the Honda driver did not feel himself pushed into driving as he did by the officer’s proximity.  On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO’s speed, weighed in the balance against the extenuating considerations, transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.In the result, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOconducted himself other than within the confines of the criminal law as he pursued the Honda, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges.Date:	May 10, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1352

The question, in my view, is readily answered in the negative.  Given the information at their disposal,WO#1 andWO#2 were within their rights in attending at the Probation and Parole Office to seek the Complainant’s arrest.  Prior to arriving at the office, they had sought without success to locate and arrest the Complainant at his home.  They had also checked the Complainant’s record and had no reason to believe that he would be armed or dangerous.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that they approached the matter with reasonable care and caution.  Once at the Probation and Parole Office, and having advised the Complainant that he was under arrest, the officers had little time to react as the Complainant retrieved his weapon and used it to shoot himself.  Thereafter, the record indicates thatWO#1 andWO#2 did what they could to render medical aid while they waited for paramedics.In the result, as I am satisfied that the Complainant is alone responsible for his self-inflicted death, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case against any police officer, and the file is closed.Date:	May 19, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=771

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,Paramedics arrived on the scene and the Complainant was taken to hospital where he was treated and admitted for psychiatric examination,"Section 34 of theCriminal Codedefines the limits within which an act that would otherwise constitute an offence is justified in the defence of oneself or another from a reasonably apprehended attack, actual or threatened.  In essence, such an act is lawful if it is reasonable in the circumstances, including with a view to such considerations as the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; and, whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon.  In my view, the lethal force used by theSOwas justified pursuant to section 34.At the outset, it is important to note that theSO,WO#2 andWO#1 were in the lawful discharge of their duties when they entered the fourth-floor hallway and confronted the Complainant.  They were there in response to an emergency 911 call to police from a resident on the fourth-floor reporting that the Complainant was mentally unwell, armed with a knife and attempting to enter her apartment.  Indeed, they located the Complainant in front of the very same apartment on the fourth-floor.Each of the officers indicated in their statements to theSIUthat the Complainant represented a real and serious threat to their health and safety as he began to pursue them with a cleaver in hand.  There is nothing in the evidence to cast doubt on the veracity of their stated mindsets.  On the contrary, an objective assessment of the circumstances that prevailed at the time, discussed below, lends credence to their evidence.The first and perhaps most important piece of evidence is the cleaver that the Complainant was holding.  It was recovered by theSIUin the north/south fourth-floor hallway a short distance from where the Complainant fell after he was shot.  It was entirely metal in construction with a blade measuring about 18 centimetres long by 8 centimetres wide.  Clearly, the cleaver was capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death.The evidence also clearly establishes that the Complainant was approaching the officers with the cleaver held high in his right hand, and that he was doing so in a threatening fashion.  Despite being told repeatedly to stop and drop the cleaver, he continued to advance on the officers while challenging them to “shoot him”.  I accept that the Complainant was not of sound mind at the time and that his behaviour was the unfortunate product of what appears to have been longstanding mental illness.  That said, the officers did not have the luxury of time to do otherwise than react to the dangerous situation unfolding before them; not more than 40 had seconds elapsed from the moment they first encountered the Complainant until shots were fired.The tactical considerations brought to bear by the officers and the sequence of events leading to the shooting are compelling and instructive.  The officers went in with a plan, namely, that they would first use less-lethal force should the need arise and only resort to a firearm as a last option.  I am unable to fault the officers for having their weapons at the ready as they made their way onto the fourth-floor given the information they had been provided about a knife in the Complainant’s possession.  It is also telling that the words first exchanged with the Complainant amounted to an inquiry byWO#1 asking about the object in his hand.  It is true that the substance and tone of the conversation quickly became loud and confrontational, but that seems to have occurred only after the Complainant turned toward the officers and started to walk in their direction.  Even then, the officers refrained for a period beforeWO#2 andWO#1, in accordance with what they had agreed, discharged their weapons at the Complainant from a distance of about five to six metres.  The Complainant continued to approach the officers and was met again with a further discharge fromWO#2’sCEWwhen he had closed the gap to about three to four metres.  While the Complainant seemed to seize up from theCEWdischarge, he did not drop the cleaver and was soon able to continue to make his way forward.  About six seconds after the secondCEWdischarge,WO#1 fired his shotgun a third and fourth time.  Despite being hit by the rounds, the Complainant kept coming and was finally felled by two shots fired from theSO’s handgun.  On this record, it is clear that the officers acted proportionately in dealing with the threat level as it evolved and only resorted to lethal force when their attempts at lesser force had failed to neutralize the Complainant and at a point when the Complainant was within two to three metres of the officers.  At that range, equipped with a cleaver and disposed as he was, there can be little doubt that the Complainant represented an imminent risk of death or grievous bodily harm to the lives of theSO,WO#2 andWO#1.   Even then, theSOtook aim at the Complainant’s lower body for fear that a missed round aimed at his chest could enter an apartment and harm a resident.  That decision not only mitigated the risks of third-party casualties but may well also have prevented the Complainant’s death.On the aforementioned-record, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that the force used by theSO, and that ofWO#2 andWO#1 for that matter, fell outside the scope of legal justification.  On the contrary, I am persuaded that the officers’ conduct fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to protect against a real and immediate threat to life and limb.  More specifically, with respect to theSO, the evidence satisfies me that having waited as long as he did to fire his weapon, he could wait no longer given the Complainant’s proximity and the resulting jeopardy to the officers’ lives.As this case involved an individual who was injured in an interaction with police while in a mental health crisis, the question is raised regarding the possible deployment of theTPSMobile Crisis Intervention Team (MCIT).  The teams bring together officers specifically trained in de-escalation techniques with mental health nurses to rapidly respond to situations involving “emotionally disturbed persons”.  They are part of the police service’s strategy for achieving positive outcomes when dealing with persons threatening self-harm or harm to others because of behaviour attributable to a mental or emotional crisis.  Whether these resources were available or not at the time officers were dispatched to the scene, it is apparent that theMCITwould not have been deployed as the policy governing the teams preclude their use as first responders to incidents involving weapons.  This was such a case.In the final analysis, as I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSO, andWO#2 andWO#1, conducted themselves lawfully and used only force that was justified pursuant to section 34 of theCriminal Code, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case against the officers.

,Toronto Police Service,Grey,Ontario,The Complainant was diagnosed with multiple fractures,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  Liability for the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In the instant case, the issue is whether there was any want of care in the manner in which theSOentered the intersection that caused or contributed to the collision and was sufficiently derelict as to attract criminal sanction.  In my view, there was not.At the outset, it should be noted that theSOwas engaged in the lawful execution of his duties as he travelled west on Sheppard Avenue toward the scene at which a person had been reported with a knife.The video evidence indicates that the officer operated his cruiser with due care and regard for the traveling public around him as he made his way westward on Sheppard Avenue West from Yonge Street.  While his speeds were at times north of 100 km/h, it does not appear that other motorists were at any point adversely impacted by the operation of theSO’s cruiser.  The same can be said of the officer’s travel through intersections.  Though most of these occurred on green lights, there were a couple of occasions in which it appears theSOslowed but did not stop before entering the intersection.  While the officer ought to have brought his vehicle to a complete stop on these occasions pursuant to theHighway Traffic Act, the evidence establishes that other motorists were at no point imperiled by theSO’s conduct in this regard.  Once at Allen Road, the evidence indicates that theSObrought his cruiser to a stop and only entered the intersection after northbound and southbound traffic in the vicinity had come to a stop.  Regrettably, neither theSOnor his passenger,WO#1, saw the Complainant’s Tesla accelerating toward the intersection at speeds in excess of 100 km/h until just before impact.  While it may be that theSOought to have taken greater precaution to ensure that the far west through lane of Allen Road was clear before he accelerated into its path, it would appear that the Complainant’s excessive speed played a role in the officer’s misjudgment.  Be that as it may, theSO’s indiscretion, if it be such, amounted to a momentary lapse of attention in a course of conduct that was otherwise duly diligent.On the aforementioned record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law notwithstanding the collision in which he had a part.

,Toronto Police Service,King,Ontario,Following his arrest paramedics arrived at the scene and took the Complainant to hospital where he was reportedly diagnosed with fractures of his right wrist and foot,"Pursuant to section 34 of theCriminal Code, the use of force that would otherwise amount to an offence is justified where it was intended to thwart a reasonably apprehended attack, actual or threatened, and where said force was reasonable.  The reasonableness of the force is to be assessed in light of the relevant circumstances, including such considerations as the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; and, whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon.  In the instant case, the issue is whether section 34 is reasonably available to cloak in justification the use by theSOof his vehicle to strike the Complainant.  In my view, it is.There is no doubt that theSOand the other officers that converged on the scene were in the lawful execution of their duties as they tried to protect the public while taking the Complainant into custody.  They had grounds to believe that the Complainant had just attacked another male, attempting to steal his bike, while holding a knife.  This was the information that had come in from 911 callers and was conveyed to officers by dispatch.  The Complainant fit the description of the male in question; he was holding a knife, refusing to drop it, and intermittently lunging at officers with the knife in hand as he made his way southward toward Front Street.  The Complainant was clearly subject to arrest.Whether because he was intoxicated by drugs and/or alcohol, or in the throes of acute mental distress, the officers seem to have appreciated from an early point that the Complainant was mentally unwell.  With that in mind, they did what they could to contain the Complainant by ushering pedestrians away from the scene and attempting to deal with him from a distance.  They pleaded with him to drop the knife and trained firearms andCEWs in his direction.  The Complainant seemed oblivious to their entreaties, at times advancing upon the officers but mostly just continuing his trek toward Front Street.  By the time theSOstruck the Complainant from behind, multipleCEWdischarges and a couple of pepper spray discharges had failed to have any effect on him.  The former were hampered by the thick jacket the Complainant was wearing, the latter stymied by the wind blowing at the time.  Even several intentional impacts between two police vehicles and the Complainant, executed a low speed, had failed to neutralize him in any way; the Complainant simply bumped off the cruiser and continued on his way.Against this backdrop, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the use by theSOof his cruiser to strike the Complainant constituted unreasonable force.  TheSOsays that he was concerned that the Complainant represented a real and present danger to the health and safety of the public at the time.  The officer’s concerns, in my view, were not without foundation.  There were people on Front Street who were at imminent risk of bodily harm or even death in the event the Complainant turned on them.  That he might do so was not fanciful speculation; he had just attacked a man in the area of King Street and was behaving erratically while wielding a knife.  And prior attempts to take the Complainant into custody viaCEWs and pepper spray had not worked, with little prospect that continued resort to those weapons would be any more effective.  It should be noted finally that theSO, cognizant of the risk of serious injury, approached and struck the Complainant at low speed; about 10 km/h, according to the officer.  On this record, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSO’s use of his cruiser was commensurate with the exigencies at hand.In the final analysis, while I accept that some if not all of the Complainant’s injuries[2]were incurred in his collision with theSO’s cruiser, I am persuaded on reasonable grounds that his conduct fell within the ambit of justification prescribed by section 34 of theCriminal Code.

The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances. I am satisfied that theSO’s conduct in her brief engagement with the Complainant did not transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.At the outset, it bears noting that theSOwas in the lawful execution of her duty at the time of the events in question. The police had reason to believe that the Complainant had stolen the pickup truck. He was in the area where the reports of suspicious activity originated and immediately fled in the vehicle upon being confronted by the police. Accordingly, pursuant to the regulation governing police pursuits in the province – O Reg 266/10 – theSOwas within her rights in initiating a pursuit of the pickup truck.The speeds attained by theSOin the course of the pursuit are of some concern. TheGPSdata associated with her cruiser clocked her reaching a top speed of about 160 km/h, more than three times the 50 km/h speed limit. At the best of times, speeds in that neighbourhood are inherently risky.The risks associated with theSO’s speed, however, are tempered by a number of considerations. For starters, the officer was exempt from liability for speeding under section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act. While that section does not provide officers carte-blanche to speed as they wish without regard for public safety, it does provide a degree of mitigation in the reasonableness analysis of theSO’s conduct. Moreover, there is no reason to believe that theSO’s speed unduly pushed or contributed to the Complainant’s reckless driving. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that theSOwas a fair distance back of the pickup as it neared the intersection of George Johnston Road and Highway 26. Finally, though the officer’s pursuit of the pickup occurred in a residential area, there is no reason to believe that theSO’s driving ever endangered any third party. In this regard, it is important to note that traffic would have been little to non-existent given the time of day the pursuit occurred, theSO’s use of her emergency lights, and the very brief period over which theSOpursued the Complainant - under a kilometre in distance and about half-a-minute in time.In the result, I am satisfied on the aforementioned record that theSOcomported herself within the confines of the law as she briefly pursued the Complainant before the collision.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Lakeshore,Ontario,But for the injury to the arm all of the wounds travelled front to back through the body,"Section 34 of theCriminal Codedefines the limits within which an act that would otherwise constitute an offence is justified in the defence of oneself or another from a reasonably apprehended attack, actual or threatened.  In essence, such an act is justified if it is reasonable in the circumstances, including with a view to such considerations as the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; and, whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon.  In my view, the lethal force used bySO#1 andSO#2 was justified pursuant to section 34.Each of the subject officers was in the lawful course of his duties when they responded to the address in the area of Lakeshore Road North and Wedgewood Avenue.  As far as they knew, they were dealing with an emergency situation involving firearms and the threat of force against persons inside the home.  The call fromCW#1 was categorized as a home invasion in progress.SO#2 says that he fired his weapon to protect himself and his partner,SO#1, from what he believed was an imminent risk of gunfire by the Complainant.  I have no reason to doubt thatSO#2’s apprehensions in this regard were both genuine and reasonable.  Nor do I have cause to suspect thatSO#1 was not of a similar mindset when he discharged his weapon even though there is no direct evidence of this as the officer did not interview with theSIU.  The circumstantial evidence overwhelmingly suggests as much.While it is true that the Complainant was only ever in possession of a toy handgun, in the fraught atmosphere that prevailed at the time, in which the officers had grounds to believe that the Complainant was armed with a real firearm and had threatened to kill persons inside the home, I am unable to fault the officers for believing they were dealing with a genuine threat of gunfire, particularly as the object in the Complainant’s hand looked like a real gun.Notwithstanding they had reason to believe the Complainant was brandishing a real handgun, and that their lives were in peril the moment the Complainant appeared at the top of the staircase, the officers did not immediately resort to their firearms.  Instead, they retreated a distance as the Complainant moved toward them, handgun pointed at the officers, while ordering him to stop.  Each officer only fired when the Complainant had moved to within a couple of metres ofSO#2 and at a point when they could retreat no further without exiting the home entirely.  While it is conceivable that the officers might have withdrawn from the situation entirely through the rear door, doing so was not a realistic option in the face of a subject pointing what appeared to be an actual firearm in their direction and the presence ofCW#4 on the second-floor.There is also evidence that the Complainant voiced suicidal ideations in the moments preceding the officers’ arrival at the home, in which he specifically talked about provoking a shootout with the police that would cause his death.  Though the officers would not have been aware of this information, it lends credibility to the officers’ fears that their lives were in jeopardy as it suggests the Complainant would have conducted himself in such a fashion as to create the appearance of an actual threat, not merely a contrived one.Lastly, the number of shots fired - four bySO#2 and two bySO#1 - merits examination.  As the officers discharged their weapons in relative proximity to each other and in rapid succession, I am unable to infer any appreciable difference in the nature of the threat each officer would have reasonably apprehended throughout the gunfire.  That is to say, there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that the sixth shot was not as legally justified as the first.  This conclusion is bolstered by the evidence suggesting the Complainant only collapsed to the floor after the final round was discharged.The Complainant was clearly not himself around the time of the shooting.  He was variously aggressive, violent, paranoid and suicidal.  Various drugs were detected in blood taken from the Complainant at autopsy, which may account for some if not all of this behaviour.  Be that as it may, the subject officers were responding to an emergency situation in which they had good reason to believe that the Complainant represented a real and present danger to the life and health of someone inside the home.  Thereafter, face-to-face with the Complainant pointing what appeared to be a handgun in their direction, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that they acted within the scope of legally justified force when they discharged their weapons.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case against either ofSO#1 andSO#2, and the file is closed.Date:	January 18, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1049
,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,The injuries caused by this bullet would likely have been non-fatal in the pathologist’s opinion with medical attention,"Section 34 of theCriminal Codesets out the circumstances in which conduct that would otherwise constitute an offence is legally justified in defence of oneself or another.  It provides that a person may use force to repel a reasonably apprehended attack, actual or threatened, as long as the force is reasonable.  The reasonableness of the force in question is to be measured on the basis of the relevant circumstances that prevailed at the time, including such considerations as the nature of the force or threat; the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force; whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon; and, the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force.  Upon careful consideration of the evidence collected by theSIU, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the force used by theSOfell outside the ambit of section 34’s protection.I have little doubt that theSObelieved he was acting in self-defence, and perhaps in defence of his partner,WO#2, when he discharged his firearm at Mr. Campbell.  TheSOdid not avail himself of an interview with theSIU, which was his legal right.  Of course, that means there is no direct evidence regarding the officer’s mindset at the time of the shooting.  Nevertheless, there is nothing in the circumstantial evidence, to be explored below, that would cause me to believe theSOwas without a genuine belief that he was acting to protect himself, and plenty in that same body of evidence to strongly suggest that was precisely what he was doing.  The real issue, in my view, is whether theSO’s apprehensions, and the shooting they precipitated, were reasonable in the circumstances.Before turning to the reasonableness analysis, it should be noted that the officers were lawfully present inside the kitchen.  They had been called to the home by Mr. Campbell and were let into the house byCW#2.  They were duty bound, in the circumstances, to investigate the reported domestic disturbance that had prompted Mr. Campbell’s call and thus were within their rights to followCW#2 into the kitchen.There is a strong case to be made that theSOreasonably believed that he needed to fire his gun to protect himself against the imminent risk of a knife attack at the hands of Mr. Campbell.  Mr. Campbell had in his possession a dangerous weapon – a knife with a long blade – that could be used to inflict grievous bodily harm or death.  By the time of the shooting, the officers had been unable to dispossess Mr. Campbell of the knife despite repeated direction that he drop it, severalCEWdischarges (one or more of which that might have successfully connected), and a physical struggle on the kitchen floor.  It did not appear that Mr. Campbell was about to voluntarily surrender the knife.It is also likely, in my view, that Mr. Campbell had obtained the knife in order to wield it as a weapon.  While there was some evidence that Mr. Campbell simply had the knife in his hands because he was using it to prepare food in the kitchen, the weight of the evidence, including that coming from some members of the Campbell family, suggests that he had retrieved it just before the officers’ entry into the kitchen in order to confront them with it. For example,CW#2 noted that Mr. Campbell was not in the kitchen when she left to answer the officers’ knock on the door. In addition,CW#4 says she overheard her mother asking Mr. Campbell why he had a knife as she (CW#2) and the officers entered the kitchen.  This same evidence lends credence toWO#2’s account of the manner in which Mr. Campbell was holding the knife when they first saw him and then again just before he was shot, namely, up by his chest area and pointed toward the officers, albeit it must be acknowledged that there is contrary evidence in this area.  Mr. Campbell’s sisters,CW#3 andCW#4, each say that Mr. Campbell’s arms were down by his side just before he was shot.With respect to whether there were alternatives other than a resort to lethal force, it is arguable whether the officers, confronted by an individual holding a knife, ought to have withdrawn from the kitchen.  It is conceivable that a retreat of some extent might have de-escalated the situation and averted a physical and, ultimately, lethal confrontation.  Instead, as it turned out, theSOimmediately began to yell at Mr. Campbell upon entering the kitchen to drop the knife while pointing aCEWat him, quickly turning the interaction into an armed standoff.  On the one hand, theSOandWO#2 had no reason to believe that there had been any violence involving Mr. Campbell and members of his family prior to their arrival and, therefore, some basis to conclude that the balance of risks favoured disengagement.  On the other hand, if Mr. Campbell had given no indication of violence ahead of their arrival, the same cannot be said once the officers were in the kitchen.  More to the point, Mr. Campbell’s presence in the kitchen with a large knife and steadfast refusal to drop it would have impressed on the officers that he was capable of inflicting harm on them.  But not only them, on Mr. Campbell’s family as well; after all, it was Mr. Campbell who had demanded that the police attend his residence to assist in an argument with his parents.  I am further satisfied that withdrawal would not have been a simple matter.  Given the confined space in which Mr. Campbell and the officers found themselves, it is not readily apparent that the officers had the necessary freedom of movement to safely and successfully remove themselves from the kitchen.  In the circumstances, I am unable to dismiss as unreasonable the officers’ decision to stand their ground.Finally, whether Mr. Campbell moved toward the officers just before he was shot is an important part of the inquiry and also the subject of discrepant accounts in the evidence.CW#3 andCW#4 maintain that their brother was standing in place, not having made any movements toward the officers, when theSOdischarged his firearm.  In contrast,WO#2 says that Mr. Campbell took one or two deliberate steps forward before he was shot.  I am unable to resolve this conflict in the evidence.  While there is evidence thatCW#3 was not in the kitchen at the time of the shooting, I have no reason to question the veracity ofCW#4’s description of her brother’s movements. Similarly, there is nothing in the evidence to cast doubt on the credibility ofWO#2’s evidence.  Accordingly, I accept that there is some evidence to reasonably conclude that Mr. Campbell had not in fact advanced upon theSOwhen he was shot. That conclusion, however, is not the end of the analysis.In the fraught atmosphere that prevailed at the time, it is entirely plausible that a reasonable person in theSO’s shoes would believe that he or she was at immediate risk of a knife attack by Mr. Campbell when the officer discharged his firearm, whether or not Mr. Campbell had taken any steps toward him.  The weight of the evidence, for example, establishes that Mr. Campbell was at the very least swaying on his feet when he was shot.  It may be that Mr. Campbell was doing so not with any malevolent intention but simply because he had just been “tasered” and was therefore naturally unsteady on his feet.  However, the suggestion does not detract from the distinct possibility that Mr. Campbell’s gestures led theSOto reasonably believe that he was on the verge of being attacked.On the aforementioned-record, I am unable to reasonably conclude with any confidence that theSOacted without legal justification when he shot Mr. Campbell.  On the contrary, the evidence suggests that theSOcredibly believed at the time that he was confronted with a real and present danger to life and limb, and that his use of force was reasonable in the circumstances.  Though faced with an individual wielding a large knife in his direction, theSOdid not immediately draw his firearm. Rather, as with his partner,WO#2, the officer pointed hisCEWat Mr. Campbell and directed him to drop the knife.  It was only after severalCEWdischarges and a physical struggle on the floor had failed to dispossess Mr. Campbell of the knife that theSOdrew his firearm.  Whether in the cold light of hindsight it can be said that shooting Mr. Campbell was absolutely necessary in the moment to protect theSOor his partner from an immediate risk of death or grievous bodily arm is arguable.  To reiterate, there is evidence that Mr. Campbell had not made any movement to close the distance between him and the officers when the shots were fired.  That said, Mr. Campbell was already in close proximity to theSOwhen theSOdischarged his firearm. In the context of what was a highly dynamic and violent confrontation with an individual brandishing a knife, I am satisfied that there is insufficient evidence to reasonably establish that theSO’s gunfire amounted to an unlawful use of force.[5]This case and others raise important and systemic issues about the manner in which police respond to mental health calls.  This was one such call.  While en route to Mr. Campbell’s residence, theSOandWO#2 were advised that Mr. Campbell suffered from mental illness, specifically, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  They were also informed that the police had last been to the address in February 2019 as Mr. Campbell had not been taking his medication and was being aggressive with family members.TheSIU’s statutory mandate, however, is a narrow one.  It is to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed by applying the law as it stands to the facts as they are discerned, not to delve into broader public policy considerations that may be implicated in any particular case.  There are other bodies with the institutional mandates and competence to conduct those reviews.  This does not mean that questions of mental health that are raised in the specific circumstances of an incident are not relevant in a criminal investigation; of course, they may well be.  It does mean that care must be taken to ensure that the inquiry remains focused on the conduct of the individuals, not the merits or failings of the system within which they operate.In the instant case, the conduct of theSOandWO#2 in the lead-up to the encounter with Mr. Campbell is in some ways subject to legitimate criticism.  Though they knew that Mr. Campbell suffered from mental illness and was likely in an agitated condition, they did not confer with each other about the approach they would take once inside the home.  Thus, there was no talk of how they would react in the face of various contingencies, such as who between them would take the lead in dealing with Mr. Campbell or how de-escalation might be pursued should the need present itself.  Whether those conversations would have made a difference to the outcome is speculation, but the officers’ failure to have that discussion limited their ability to consider alternative strategies.  Moreover, once in the kitchen, theSOimmediately began to order Mr. Campbell to put the knife down.  At no point was there any effort made to verbally calm Mr. Campbell.The offence that arises for consideration in light of this conduct iscriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that constitutes a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In my view, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the officers transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law in the moments before their standoff with Mr. Campbell.  Thus, while the officers perhaps should have done more to take stock of the situation before they knocked on the door, it is not as if the officers entered the home without some appreciation of what they might encounter.WO#2, for example, says she was cognizant of the fact there were no sounds of a disturbance coming from the house as they knocked on the front door.  Once through the door, there were also no signs of trouble in the household.CW#2 confirmed that there had been an argument involving Mr. Campbell and that he suffered from mental illness, but otherwise everything appeared calm.  Finally, with respect to the tact adopted by the officers upon seeing Mr. Campbell, their failure to meaningfully engage in any efforts to talk Mr. Campbell down is tempered by the fact that they were being confronted by an individual pointing a knife in their direction.  On this record, if there were lapses in judgment on the part ofWO#2 or theSO, they were neither reckless nor wanton in the circumstances.There remains the question of the potential deployment of thePRPCrisis Outreach Assessment Support Team, or COAST.  Each COAST unit pairs a plainclothes officer with a mental health professional, who are available to respond to calls on a 24-7 basis.  COAST is a method by which the police service seeks to respond more effectively to calls for service involving persons experiencing mental health crisis or emotional distress.  However, pursuant to thePRPpolicy in effect at the time, COAST units are not mobilized unless the following four conditions are met: the call involves someone 16 years of age and over who is experiencing a mental health issue; the call is not of an emergent nature; there are no weapons involved in the call; and, the situation is calm.I am unable to find fault with the decision not to deploy the COAST team in response to Mr. Campbell’s 911 call to police.  The police call-takers, who are responsible for deciding whether or not COAST involvement is appropriate, are tasked with gathering information from the caller with which to make the assessment.  These inquiries include whether the person experiencing crisis is armed or has access to weapons.  The call-taker who took Mr. Campbell’s call, however, was unable to obtain this information as Mr. Campbell, perhaps through no fault of his own, was unwilling or incapable of providing it at the time.  In the absence of any clear indication that there were no weapons involved in the incident, it seems to me that the decision to not assign COAST in this case was a prudent one and in compliance with the policy in effect at the time.  In any event, given that Mr. Campbell did in fact have a knife in his possession, it is not clear that COAST could have played much of a role in the incident even had they been initially deployed.In conclusion, Mr. Campbell’s death was doubtless a tragedy.  He was clearly unwell and not of sound mind when he picked up a knife and brandished it at theSOandWO#2.  However, as I have no reasonable grounds based on the foregoing analysis to believe theSOacted other than lawfully in his interaction with Mr. Campbell, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	December 3, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1010
,Ontario Provincial Police,Kingston,Ontario,Complainant 1 was treated for a fractured back and broken ribs,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code. As an offence of penal negligence, the crime is premised, in part, on conduct that deviates markedly from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances. In my view, theSO’s conduct throughout his engagement with the Jeep Compass did not breach the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.At the outset, I accept that theSOwas within his rights in initiating a pursuit of the Jeep vehicle. He had measured its speed moving eastward toward him on Highway 401 at 176 km/h, grossly in excess of the 100 km/h speed limit. Moving that fast, the officer had clear and obvious grounds to stop the vehicle and its driver for variousHighway Traffic Actoffences, if not the offence ofdangerous drivingunder theCriminal Code.TheSO’s speed is itself subject to legitimate scrutiny. In attempting to catch up with the Jeep Compass as it sped past his location, theSOtravelled well over the speed limit, topping out at about 180 km/h. At the best of times, that speed, in my view, carries with it a degree of danger. TheSO’s speeds, however, were not enough to render his conduct criminal.For starters, given the velocity with which the Jeep was traveling, it is not surprising that theSOwould have reached his top end speeds as he was attempting to close the distance with the vehicle in front of him. At the time, theSOwas engaged in the lawful execution of his duty and, accordingly, was exempt from the speed limitations pursuant to section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act. The provision, while not granting officerscarte blancheto speed as they wish without regard to public safety, provides a degree of mitigation in the reasonableness analysis of theSO’s conduct.It also bears noting that theSO’s engagement with the Jeep was short-lived. A total distance of 6.5 kilometres separated the point at which theSOfirst began to accelerate after the Jeep until the point of collision at the Palace Road off-ramp. It also occurred at a time when there would have been less traffic on the roadway, and therefore less risk to third-party motorists. In fact, there is no indication that anyone was actually endangered by the speed at which theSOwas travelling.Finally, I am satisfied that theSO’s speed did not unduly fuelCW#1’s reckless driving. Indeed, it does not appear thatCW#1 was even aware of theSO’s presence behind her until just before the Palace Road exit. In the circumstances, while I suspect thatCW#1 took the off-ramp in an effort to flee from the police, she had ample opportunity to adjust her driving behaviour and is alone responsible for her failure to do so and the resulting collision.In the result, as I am satisfied on the foregoing record that theSOcomported himself within the limits of the law as he pursued the Jeep Compass, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	October 13, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=968
,Ontario Provincial Police,Dufferin,Ontario,Complainant 1 and Complainant 2 were taken to hospital where the former was diagnosed with a fractured femur the latter various head and rib fractures,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code. As an offence of penal negligence, not any departure from the standard of reasonable care will suffice to ground liability. What is required, in part, is a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.There are aspects of theSO’s conduct that are open to legitimate scrutiny. Chief among these was his speed. By his own admission, as confirmed by the GPS data associated with his cruiser, theSOaccelerated to speeds upwards of 200 km/h and was consistently over 190 km/h on Highway 401 as he sped westward attempting to catch up with the Sonata. While west on Wilson Avenue, theSOtravelled in and around the speed limit until he arrived in the area of Wilson Heights Boulevard, whereupon his velocity increased significantly, topping out at about 132 km/h. Finally, while north on Keele Street, theSOdrove regularly over 120 km/h, reaching a top speed of 142 km/h. In my view, the speed at which theSOwas driving through lengthy portions of his engagement with the Sonata was inherently dangerous.Adding to the danger was the fact that theSOintentionally decided to avoid using his emergency lights and siren except on several occasions as he was making his way through intersections. The officer explained that it was his practice to not activate his emergency equipment in these circumstances as, in his experience, doing so regularly prompted the drivers of the speeding vehicles to increase their speed as they tried to get away. When that happens, according to theSO, he is compelled to terminate the pursuit immediately, thereby frustrating his law enforcement efforts.TheSOmisconceives the nature of his duty and the regulation governing police pursuits in the province – O Reg 266/10. Whether an officer activates emergency equipment in an effort to pull someone over is a factor in assessing whether a pursuit within the terms of the regulation has occurred, but it is not necessarily a decisive one. In my view, the fact that theSOwas speeding as fast as he was after the Sonata, for as long as he was, clearly suggests he was in pursuit. Moreover, the fact that the driver of a vehicle accelerates away after being signaled to pull over does not automatically mean that the officer is obliged to terminate the pursuit. That determination is made on a rolling basis as the officer considers the balance of public safety considerations. At times, this assessment will justify the continuation of a pursuit; at other times, it will dictate that the pursuit be discontinued. Finally, theSOis simply wrong to suggest that he was free to speed in the fashion he did because, in his view, he was not captured by the edicts of O Reg 266/10. Public safety must at all times be at the forefront of an officer’s objectives. If theSO’s speed was unsafe, then it was unsafe regardless of whether he was in a pursuit or not.In my view, theSOought to have used his emergency lights and siren far more than he did as he pursued the Sonata. While I accept that there will be times when officers will reasonably choose to avoid using their emergency equipment for one reason or another as they travel at speed, this does not seem to be one of those occasions. Complainant #1 was already traveling recklessly and at great speed when theSOfirst noticed the Sonata. It is difficult to believe that the use by the officer of his lights and siren would have markedly aggravated Complainant #1’s dangerous driving. On the contrary, it seems to me that the greater concern in the circumstances would have been to alert motorists and pedestrians in the vicinity of theSO’s cruiser, giving them more time to react to the speed at which he was approaching.On the other side of the ledger, the risks created by theSO’s speed and non-use of his emergency equipment are mitigated to a degree by several considerations. It should be noted, for example, that theSOhad reasonable cause to initiate a pursuit of the Sonata for speeding under O Reg 266/10. Not only was the Complainant in apparent violation of theHighway Traffic Act, he was conceivably also committing the criminal offence of dangerous driving. That being the case, theSOwas exempt from the speeding limitations under section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act. This is not to suggest that theSOhad free rein to speed as he wished without regard to public safety, but simply to say that the officer’s conduct was not entirely without justification.The prevailing environmental conditions were also favourable. The roadways were dry and in good repair, and the weather was clear. Moreover, there was little traffic along the pursuit route given the COVID-19 control measures that were in effect. If theSO’s speed and failure to use his cruiser’s emergency equipment were ill-advised, they were less so in context. In this regard, it bears noting that there is no evidence that any third parties were ever actually endangered by the manner in which theSOwas driving.Nor is there any affirmative evidence that theSOblatantly disregarded traffic control signs and signals as he chased after the Sonata. In fact, the evidence that does exist on this front via the GPS data and the statements of theSOandWO#1 indicates that theSOslowed, if not stopped, ahead of several red lights before proceeding safely through the intersections.Finally, it is clear that theSOmaintained a fair distance behind the Sonata through most of the pursuit, and had in fact terminated his engagement several hundred metres ahead of the Keele Street and Sheppard Avenue West intersection where the collision occurred. Thus, notwithstanding the officer’s speed, I am satisfied that theSOleft the Complainant ample opportunity to slow and safely operate his vehicle had he been so inclined.In the final analysis, while I accept that theSOoperated his cruiser in an objectively dangerous fashion over a protracted distance and period of time (between 13 and 15 kilometres, and about seven minutes), I am unable to reasonably conclude that his manner of driving transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law. More specifically, weighed in the balance with the extenuating considerations outlined above, I am satisfied that theSO’s indiscretions fall short of constituting a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed. Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	September 14, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=947

,Windsor Police Service,Tecumseh,Ontario,The Complainant was transported to hospital and diagnosed with three fractured left-sided ribs,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to give rise to liability.  What is required, in part, is conduct that consists of a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  In my view, while close to the line, the evidence falls short of warranting criminal charges.I am satisfied that theSOdrove dangerously as he travelled east along Tecumseh Road East toward the point of impact with the Complainant’s vehicle at Rose-Ville Garden Drive.  Pursuant to section 144(20) of theHighway Traffic Act, police officers engaged in the execution of their lawful duty may drive through a red light but only when it is safe to do so after first coming to a stop.  By all accounts, theSOfailed in that obligation.  Though it appears the officer reduced his speed to about 60 km/h as he approached the Rose-Ville Garden Drive intersection, down from upwards of 80 km/h, he did not bring his vehicle to a stop and struck the Complainant’s vehicle at a speed of about 40 km/h.  The collision was entirely avoidable; had theSOstopped, as he was obliged to do, he presumably would have seen the Complainant enter the intersection ahead of his path of travel.The Complainant’s indiscretions, however, do not end there.  A video recording from a surveillance camera situated along the path of the cruiser’s travel indicates that the officer also proceeded through a red light at the Westminster Boulevard intersection without first stopping.  According to theGPSdata, it appears that the officer had also reduced his speed as he approached and then travelled through the intersection – down to 49 km/h from about 80 km/h.  In the circumstances, it cannot be said that theSO’s want of care at Rose-Ville Garden Drive was a momentary lapse of judgment.Despite theSO’s multipleHTAinfractions as he travelled on Tecumseh Road East, there are enough extenuating considerations at play to render the officer’s conduct something less than a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care.  For starters, it should be noted that theSOwas responding to a serious call for service involving a potential domestic-related assault and the use of a possible weapon.  Thus, while the nature of the call cannot excuse the officer’s failure to stop at red lights, the fact that time was of the essence is a mitigating factor in the reasonableness analysis.The same may be said of theSO’s speeds on Tecumseh Road East.  While at times over the 60 km/h speed limit (as high as 94 km/h for brief periods), at no time were the officer’s speeds grossly excessive, particularly when weighed against the gravity of the call to which he was responding.  In similar vein, mention must be made of section 128(13) of theHTA, which exempts police officers from speed limitations while engaged in the course of their duties.  Though the provision does not provide officers free rein to speed as they wish without regard to public safety, it too militates against a finding of unreasonableness in the instant case.Finally, the weight of the evidence indicates that theSOused his emergency lights and siren along his path of travel on Tecumseh Road East, giving motorists around him advance warning of his approach and allowing them time to maneuver safely out of the cruiser’s way.  Indeed, it may be that the Complainant would have seen the officer’s approach with lights and siren on had it not been for a significant sightline obstruction created by the building at the southwest corner of the Tecumseh Road East and Rose-Ville Garden Drive intersection.There are other factors that bear on the reasonableness of theSO’s conduct but none which tip the balance against the officer.  For example, Tecumseh Road East was predominantly lined with commercial premises with some residential buildings along the cruiser’s path of travel.  Moreover, given the time of day and the evidence from the video recordings, I am satisfied that there was a fair amount of traffic on the roadway.  These considerations no doubt elevated the overall risk associated with theSO’s driving.  However, they must be balanced against the fact that the roads were dry and the weather was good at the time in question, and no motorist or pedestrian (aside, of course, from the Complainant) appears to have had to take emergency evasive action to avoid theSO’s cruiser.The liability analysis might well be different if it could be established that theSOdisregarded other red lights as he travelled eastward on Tecumseh Road East.  Indeed, when one cross-references theGPSdata associated with theSO’s cruiser with theHITreports detailing the colour of the traffic control signals along the officer’s route, there is a suggestion that the officer may also have travelled through the red lights at Meldrum Drive, Central Avenue, George Avenue, Jefferson Boulevard and the Home Depot access road without stopping.   The suggestion, however, amounts to more speculation than hard fact because the times between theGPSdata and theHITreports were not synchronized.In the final analysis, while I am persuaded on the foregoing analysis that theSOdrove dangerously and, in so doing, directly caused or contributed to the collision that resulted in the Complainant’s injuries, I am unable to reasonably conclude with a sufficient degree of confidence that the officer’s conduct amounted to a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	February 8, 2021Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1097

,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,Following the Complainant’s arrest he was taken to hospital from the scene and diagnosed with a fractured nose,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law. When theSOfirst came across the Honda vehicle, he ran a check on the licence plate on a police database and learned that it had been reported stolen. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that theSOwas within his rights in seeking to stop the Honda to investigate a possible theft. Thereafter, when the Complainant refused to stop and instead drove his vehicle into a roadblock, striking and damaging an uninvolved third-party vehicle as well as theSO’s cruiser, he was further subject to lawful arrest for dangerous driving. The issue turns to the propriety of the force that was used by the officers in the Complainant’s apprehension.The struggle on the ground was preceded by a forceful takedown of the Complainant by theSOandWO#9, who grabbed the Complainant and yanked him to the ground. In my estimation, the tactic was necessary in the circumstances. The Complainant had made clear his intentions that he was not about to peacefully surrender to the police and had used his Honda to violently strike a couple of vehicles in an attempt to escape. The officers could reasonably expect further resistance from the Complainant and were entitled to meet that threat by grounding him at the first opportunity; with the Complainant on the ground, the officers would be in a better position to deal with any further aggression on the part of the Complainant. The Complainant continued to resist on the ground, refusing to release his arms to the officers, and was met with a single punch apiece by each of theSOandWO#9. Those punches struck the Complainant’s torso and do not appear to have caused any injury. In the context of the vehicular collisions that had just occurred, and the Complainant’s continued resistance once extricated from the Honda, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the strikes constituted excessive force.Some evidence indicates that the Complainant was kicked three or four times to the back of his head and the Complainant did not resist his arrest on the ground, but I am unable to lend this account much credence on these points. This same account further suggests that the Complainant was kicked by an officer while being searched following his arrest at the side of the Honda, but a video recording of the incident would appear to belie that suggestion.In the result, while I accept that the Complainant’s nose was fractured in his encounter with police officers during his arrest, most likely the result of being thrown to the ground, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOand the other officers acted lawfully throughout the encounter. Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	July 13, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=881

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,n\nCause of Death nThe pathologist at autopsy attributed the Complainant’s death to complications of gunshot wounds to the chest and left arm,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law. In the case of lethal force, section 25(3) further provides that such force is not justified unless the officer believes on reasonable grounds that it was necessary for her or his self-preservation or the preservation of any one under their protection from death or grievous bodily harm. On the record developed by theSIU, I am unable to reasonably conclude thatSO#2,SO#3 andSO#1 transgressed the limits of legal justification when they fired their weapons at the Complainant.Clearly, theGGTFteam members were in the lawful execution of their duties when they stopped the Complainant’s pickup truck and attempted to take him into custody. The Complainant was wanted for the murder of a woman that had occurred on January 13, 2020. In fact, there was a warrant for his arrest in connection with the crime.With respect to the subject officers’ state of mind at the time, while there is no direct evidence as to what they were thinking, I am not satisfied with any degree of confidence that they lacked a reasonable belief in the necessity of a resort to lethal force to protect themselves from a risk of death or grievous bodily harm. Consider the officers’ apprehension of the threat level as they covertly tailed the Complainant and then stopped his vehicle in the middle of the roadway. They knew the Complainant was wanted in the brutal murder of a woman only days earlier. They also knew that the Complainant had a criminal record that included convictions for violence and firearms-related offences. In the circumstances, common sense dictates that the Complainant would have been approached with extreme caution as a person who was potentially armed and dangerous. That was the tenor of the witness officers’ evidence, whose assessment I have little doubt would have been shared by the subject officers.The Complainant’s behaviour once surrounded by theGGTFofficers would have done little to alleviate their concerns. Though surrounded with nowhere to go and guns pointed at him at close range, the Complainant chose not to cooperate with the officers’ repeated commands that he maintain his hands in a position where the officers could see them. The request was a legitimate one considering the officers’ reasonable fear that the Complainant might be armed with a weapon. Instead, the Complainant chose to raise and lower his hands in a fashion he must have known would escalate tensions, and argued with the officers as to the reason for his arrest. Pursuant to section 29 of theCriminal Code, persons executing arrest warrants have a legal duty, where it is feasible to do so, to notify the person to be arrested of the reason for the arrest. Given the exigencies of the situation, and what in my view was the officers’ reasonable concern that alerting the Complainant of his arrest on a murder charge might further escalate the situation, I am not satisfied that the officers were in breach of their duty. WhenSO#2 andWO#1 entered the rear passenger area of the pickup truck and took hold of his right arm, the Complainant reacted violently, pulling his arm away and taking a swing atWO#1. In short, the Complainant gave every indication of someone who was not going to peacefully surrender.Finally, the moments immediately preceding and following the shooting are particularly instructive.WO#1, positioned behind the pickup truck, observed the Complainant’s chin dip toward his knees and heard other officers saying, “Don’t lower your hands. Stop. Don’t do it,” around the time shots rang out.WO#3, standing near the rear passenger driver side of the pickup truck, indicates she heardSO#3 say, “No one wants to get hurt. Don’t reach into your jacket,” just before the Complainant pulled his jacket forward with his left hand and reached into it with his right hand. At that point, according toWO#3, she feared the Complainant was reaching for a weapon and heard multiple consecutive gunshots.WO#3’s evidence in this regard must be taken with a grain of salt. Though I accept, based on the corroborative evidence of other officers, that she observed the Complainant make some type of a gesture in the moments before the shots were fired, it is not clear to me that she would have been able to see him reaching into his jacket with his right hand given her position behind and to the left of the Complainant. Each of the three subject officers moved backwards as they discharged their weapons, a retreat they continued after the shooting to positions of cover behind police vehicles. Thereafter, it was not until another 14 minutes had elapsed that the officers felt comfortable enough to approach the pickup truck to take the Complainant into custody. On this evidence, it appears that the officers had cause to believe that the Complainant was accessing a firearm and constituted an immediate danger to the lives of those around him at the point of gunfire.On the foregoing record, I am satisfied that there is insufficient evidence to believe with any degree of certainty thatSO#2,SO#3 andSO#1 acted without legal justification when they shot and wounded the Complainant. On the contrary, it seems likely that each of the three officers harboured an honest belief in the necessity of a resort to lethal force in defence of their own lives (and possibly others) and that such belief was reasonable in the circumstances. It does not appear, at least as far as the witness officers are concerned, that they considered the use of a Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW) a viable option. Given the nature of the threat the officers reasonably believed the Complainant represented, and the winter clothing the Complainant was wearing that would have detracted from the weapon’s ability to penetrate to the skin in order to immobilize the subject, I do not believe the failure of the officers to use aCEWnegates the reasonableness of their conduct. Each of the officers was in very close proximity to the Complainant and would have been in his direct line of fire had he, as I believe they reasonably feared, been able to access a firearm. With respect to the number of shots fired, it is important to note that these occurred at the same time and in rapid succession such that I am unable to meaningfully impute any difference in the threat level each of the officers would have reasonably perceived throughout the volley of shots. Nor, in my view, do considerations of possible withdrawal or retreat change the legal calculus. The standoff occurred on a public roadway with motorists and pedestrians in the vicinity. In the circumstances, the officers would have been hard-pressed to disengage from the Complainant or deal with him at a distance without unduly jeopardizing public safety.In the result, while I accept that the officers’ gunfire contributed to the Complainant’s unfortunate death, there are no reasonable grounds to believe thatSO#2,SO#3 andSO#1 acted unlawfully in the course of this incident. Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against the officers.Date:	November 9, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1008

,,Hamilton,Ontario,u2003\nCause of Death nThe pathologist at the Complainant’s autopsy was of the view that the cause of the Complainant’s death was multiple gunshot wounds,"Whether pursuant to sections 25(3) or 34 of theCriminal Code, I am unable to reasonably conclude that either ofSO#2 orSO#1 transgressed the limits of permissible force when they discharged their firearms at the Complainant, notwithstanding the tragic loss of life. The former governs the use of lethal force by police officers in the course of their duties and requires that such force be limited to instances in which an officer reasonably believes it is necessary to preserve oneself or another from death or grievous bodily harm. The latter sets the boundaries for the justified use of force by any person in self-defence or the defence of another person. Essentially, such force is not permissible unless it is reasonable in all the circumstances, with a view to such considerations as the nature of the force or threat, the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force, and whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon.At the outset, it is readily apparent thatSO#1 andSO#2 were in the lawful execution of their duties when they responded to the Complainant’s address to investigate reports of a man with a knife behaving strangely. Moreover, when the Complainant refused to drop the knife and, instead, advanced toward the officers in a threatening fashion with the knife, he made himself subject to lawful arrest by the officers.Both officers, in their interviews with theSIU, explained that they fired at the Complainant fearing for their own lives and the lives of their partners, and believing it was necessary to preserve themselves from a mortal danger. More specifically,SO#1 andSO#2 believed the Complainant was on the cusp of a potentially lethal knife attack and that he had left them with no option but to fire their weapons. I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of the officers’ stated mindsets.The issue turns to whether theSOs’ apprehensions were reasonable in the circumstances. In my view, they were. By the timeSO#1 andSO#2 discharged their guns, the Complainant had been warned over the course of several minutes to drop the knife. I appreciate that the Complainant was in mental distress at the time and possibly not in a position to respond rationally to theSOs’ requests. By the same token, regrettably, the Complainant’s conduct would have left the officers little doubt that he was not about to surrender peacefully.It should be noted that a mental health worker,CW#4, was present at the time, partnered on the day withSO#2. However, pursuant to police protocols in effect, she remained inSO#2’s cruiser throughout the incident, reasonably in my view, given the presence of a knife in the Complainant’s possession.DespiteCW#4’s absence, there were efforts at de-escalation prior to the shots being fired.SO#2, in particular, attempted to engage in conversation with the Complainant as she followed him onto the driveway along the west side of the address on Rykert Street. She asked his name, told him she was there to help and attempted to persuade him that she was not there to hurt him. That the Complainant did not respond in kind was not for any want of trying on the part of the officer.It should further be noted thatSO#1 andSO#2 each considered the use of their Conducted Energy Weapons (CEWs) during their encounter with the Complainant, but arrived at the same conclusion that resort to the weapon was not appropriate. As theSOs explained, they were confronted with a potentially lethal weapon and did not want to risk an ineffectiveCEWdeployment, particularly as the Complainant was wearing a heavy jacket at the time that would have made it difficult for the weapons’ probes to penetrate to the skin. While in hindsight, the officers might have agreed to split their roles, with one discharging aCEWand the other acting as cover with a firearm at the ready, I am unable to faultSO#1 andSO#2 for their failure to do so given the speed and volatility with which events were unfolding.Finally, I am satisfied that theSOs exercised a reasonable amount of restraint in the hopes of resolving the situation short of the use of lethal force before their firearms were discharged. Prior toSO#1’s arrival,SO#2 had tracked the Complainant’s movements at a distance of several metres, moving in lockstep with his direction of travel. As he moved in her direction down the driveway, she walked backward, all the while imploring the Complainant to stop and drop the knife.SO#1 did the same as he entered onto the scene. Disengagement was not an option given the presence of civilians in the area and their potential jeopardy at the hands of an armed Complainant. It was not until the Complainant took a few quick steps in theSOs’ direction, as described by multiple witnesses, and came to within two to three metres of theSOs’ location that eachSOfired their weapon. On this record, I am satisfied that the lives of theSOs would have been in real jeopardy had they waited any longer to protect themselves.With respect to the number of shots that were fired, these appear to have occurred quickly with possibly a slight pause between a first and second volley. Given evidence that the Complainant continued to move forward after the initial shots, I am unable to meaningfully impute any material difference in the threat level that each officer would have reasonably appreciated throughout their gunfire.For the foregoing reasons, I am satisfied thatSO#1 andSO#2 shot the Complainant in the reasonable belief that doing so was necessary to protect themselves from an imminent knifeattack. Accordingly, as there are no reasonable grounds to believe theSOs used unlawful force, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	August 10, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=898

,Niagara Regional Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,Following his arrest at the Tim Hortons the Complainant was taken to the police station and then when he complained of pain to the hospital where his injury was diagnosed,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  There is no question around the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension at the Tim Hortons.  By all accounts, he had shoulder checkedWO#1 and was subject to arrest for assault.Nor do I believe there is much of a question around the propriety of the force used byWO#1 and theSOin effecting the Complainant’s arrest.  Despite being released from police custody, the Complainant grew increasingly belligerent in his exchanges with the police and delivered a shoulder check toWO#1.  In the circumstances, the officers were entitled to defend themselves with a measure of force of their own.WO#1 pushed the Complainant back to create some further distance between them while theSOpunched the Complainant in the face and took him to the ground to deter any further aggression, none of which were unreasonable reactions in my estimation given the Complainant’s unprovoked act of violence.While it is possible that the Complainant fractured his ankle in the course of his confrontation with theSOandWO#1, there is a possibility raised in the evidence that he was injured prior to his encounter with the police.  Be that as it may, as I am satisfied that the officers acted lawfully throughout their dealings with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	June 8, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=837

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,n r\n The material events in question are clear on the evidence collected by the SIU which included interviews with the Complainant and the SO as well as video recordings that captured the incident Shortly before 8:00 a.m on December 13 2019 the SO on patrol in a marked police SUV was stationary in the middle southbound lane of Jarvis Street north of Dundas Street when the vehicle the Complainant was driving – a blue Volkswagen Tiguan – caught his attention The Volkswagen had significant damage to its bodywork which was protruding from the side of the vehicle Considering the damage a potential hazard to other users of the road the SO decided to stop the vehicle to investigate The SO followed the Complainant as they travelled south on Jarvis Street At Shuter Street the Complainant cut in front of northbound traffic while making a left turn He was followed in kind by the SO who was now of the view that the Complainant was driving carelessly in contravention of the Highway Traffic Act The officer activated his emergency lights and sounded his siren to signal the Complainant to stop Believing he had just made an unlawful left turn and knowing he was driving a stolen vehicle the Complainant accelerated eastward away from the cruiser on Shuter Street with the SO in pursuit The vehicles continued past Sherbourne Street and sped toward Parliament Street where the Complainant attempted and failed to negotiate a left turn The Volkswagen jumped the curb and struck a concrete pole on the northeast corner of the intersection The SO arrived within seconds parked behind the Volkswagen and exited his cruiser to render aid to the Complainant.\n,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code. As an offence of penal negligence, liability is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances. The evidence falls short, in my view, of suggesting theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law. TheSOwas within his rights in seeking to pull the Complainant over to investigate the obvious damage to the vehicle he was operating. The Complainant ought to have stopped, as was his legal obligation under section 216(1) of theHighway Traffic Act. When he failed to do so, theSOwas also justified in initiating a pursuit of the Volkswagen under the regulation that governs police pursuits in the province – O. Reg. 266/10. Thereafter, I am satisfied that the officer conducted himself with due care and regard for the safety of the public. He activated his emergency lights and siren to alert motorists and pedestrians in the vicinity of the pursuit, allowing traffic to clear in the area ahead of the Volkswagen and cruiser. The officer’s speeds, in excess of the 40 km/h speed limit on Shuter Street and topping out briefly at about 90 km/h, are of concern, particularly as the pursuit occurred in a congested area over a narrow roadway. That said, I am satisfied the dangers inherent in the speeds were not grossly disproportionate in the circumstances as the weather was clear, the roadway was in good condition and the pursuit transpired over a very short period of time. In fact, the entire pursuit from start to finish took place over no more than one minute and about 730 metres. Lastly, though theSOwas relatively close to the Volkswagen through the engagement, I am satisfied he left the Complainant with sufficient opportunity to operate the Volkswagen in a safe fashion had he been so inclined.In the result, while the Complainant’s flight from police was at the root of his loss of control over the vehicle he was driving and the resultant collision, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOcontributed to the accident in any way that could attract criminal sanction, or that he otherwise drove dangerously in violation of the criminal law.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Wawa,Ontario,n r\n The following scenario emerges from the weight of the reliable evidence gathered by the SIU in its investigation On December 10 2019 OPP officers began to converge at the Complainant’s home following complaints from a woman that the Complainant had threatened to kill her and her daughter A Feeney warrant was obtained by the police authorizing the Complainant’s arrest and the officers’ entry into his dwelling-house to take him into custody With officers outside his home the Complainant taunted the police but refused to emerge from the residence Rather than force their way inside the OPP decided to bide their time while maintaining containment around the residence The standoff continued through the night Emergency Response Team officers began arriving at the scene the morning of December 11 2019 Among their ranks was the SO who was equipped with an ARWEN Shortly after 6:00 a.m the Complainant emerged from a door of his house He carried empty beer cases around his body and walked down his driveway toward officers taunting them in the process At one point the Complainant slipped and fell on some ice A number of officers moved in to arrest him but were unsuccessful The Complainant managed to get back up and retreat into his home As he did so his backside was struck by several rounds fired from the SO’s ARWEN Once inside the Complainant began to damage property in the home Eventually the Complainant exited the home surrendered to the police and was arrested without further incident n,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  The Complainant’s detention and arrest were lawful.  The Complainant had thrown an object through the window of his ex-girlfriend’s residence and then proceeded to call and threaten her and her daughter with death.  Accordingly, the police had grounds to detain him as they surrounded and contained his home.  They also had grounds to take him into custody based on aFeeneywarrant that had been issued early in the morning of December 11, 2019.With respect to theARWENrounds that were fired at the Complainant, I am satisfied they did not constitute excessive force.  The Complainant had emerged from his home belligerent and threatening the officers.  In the circumstances, the police had good reason to believe he would not be arrested peacefully.  They were also wise to want to end the standoff at the first reasonable opportunity.  Such an opportunity presented itself when the Complainant left the home and walked toward the officers.  Regrettably, the plan to deploy the police dog fell through when the dog failed to confront the Complainant, who had slipped and fallen on some ice, leaving the Complainant time to gather himself and head back inside.  Not wanting to lose the moment to take the Complainant into custody before he made it back inside and realizing that the officers were not in position to engage him physically, theSO, reasonably in my view, fired hisARWEN.  Though several rounds met their mark, none of them felled the Complainant, who retreated indoors.At the end of theSIUinvestigation, the cause of the Complainant’s broken right arm remains somewhat of a mystery.  While the likeliest scenario suggests he injured himself inside the home after being struck by theARWENrounds, the possibility that one or more of theSO’sARWENdischarges caused or contributed to the fracture cannot be dismissed.  Be that as it may, as I am satisfied that the use of theARWENfell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in an effort to effect a lawful arrest, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against theSOand the file is closed.Date:	May 19, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=807
,Toronto Police Service,Grey,Ontario,The van then moves forward and is seen driving over several small trees and reaching a dead end,"The Complainant was later seen at hospital, where it was discovered that he had a bullet fragment lodged in his hand, which had caused a fracture. The bullet fragment was surgically removed.TheSOwas identified as the subject officer for purposes of theSIUinvestigation. On my assessment of the evidence, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s arrest and injury.While theSOopted not to provide a statement toSIUinvestigators (as was his legal right), based on the statements provided by the Complainant, one other civilian and five police witnesses, as well as video footage fromCCTVcameras at the YMCA andICCSrecordings, the facts were established. On a review of this evidence, for the reasons that follow, I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe that the actions of theSO, in resorting to a use of lethal force, were excessive in these circumstances and there is, therefore, no basis for the laying of criminal charges.Whether considered pursuant to the frameworks set out in section 25(3) or 34 of theCriminal Code, the former setting out the test for legal justification in the case of lethal force used in the execution of a police officer’s duty, the latter outlining the parameters of force that is excusable in defence of oneself or another, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the conduct of theSOdid not run afoul of the limits prescribed by the criminal law.It is clear that when theSOandWO#3 followed the Complainant as he was fleeing in the stolen motor vehicle, they were acting in the course of their duties in that they were attempting to arrest the Complainant for an offence which they found him to be committing at the time, namely, possession of a stolen motor vehicle. Thereafter, as soon as the Complainant led the officers in a police pursuit and then rammed their police vehicle, they had further grounds to arrest him for additional criminal offences. As such, the officers were clearly acting within the scope of their lawful duties when they attempted to stop and arrest the Complainant.When the Complainant then began to drive directly at theSO, as is clearly seen in the video footage, after having already rammed their police vehicle, it is clear that theSOwas at risk of grievous bodily harm, if not death. In fact, other officers present at the time immediately preceding theSOdischarging his firearm believed that at least one or more of the officers were at risk of being run over by the Complainant.WO#2, in particular, took cover between two police vehicles in order to avoid being injured himself. Based on the comment made by theSO, as captured on theICCSaudio, the subject officer also feared that he was going to be run over by the Complainant and the Toyota minivan. On this basis, as supported by the video, I accept that theSOgenuinely and reasonably believed that shooting the Complainant was necessary to protect himself, or his colleagues, from loss of life or grievous bodily harm. While such action could not be expected to halt the van in its tracks, disabling its operating mind might go some ways to mitigating the immediate dangers posed by the van’s continued operation.On the aforementioned-record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO, under a legitimate apprehension that discharging his firearm was necessary to protect himself and/or his colleagues from a lethal threat, acted unreasonably in so doing, notwithstanding the injury to the Complainant. As such, as there is no basis to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed by theSO, or by any police officer present during the apprehension of the Complainant, no charges will issue, and this file is closed.Date:	June 22, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=847

,Ontario Provincial Police,Grey,Ontario,n\nCause of Death\nCause of death was attributed to “gunshot wounds to torso”,"TheSIUwas notified of the incident and commenced an investigation, which has now concluded.SO#2 andSO#1 were each designated subject officers for purposes of theSIUinvestigation. On my assessment of the evidence, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that either subject officer committed a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s death.Section 34 of theCriminal Codeprovides a legal justification for conduct that is pursued in self-defence or the defence of a third-party that might otherwise constitute an offence. In essence, a person is justified in such conduct to the extent that it was meant to thwart a reasonably apprehended use of force, or threatened use of force, against them or another person. In determining whether the conduct in question was reasonable, regard must be had to all the circumstances, including such considerations as the nature of the force or threat, the extent to which the use of force was imminent and whether there were other means available to respond to the potential use of force, and whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon.Turning first to the initial volley of gunshots fired bySO#2 andSO#1, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that both officers acted within the limits of justified force prescribed in section 34 of theCriminal Code.I begin by noting that an officer’s foremost duty at common law is the preservation of life.SO#2 andSO#1 were engaged in the lawful execution of that duty when they arrived at the residence looking to assist the firefighters with entry into the Complainant’s home. They had good reason to believe that there was a fire in the kitchen, that the Complainant was not of sound mind, and that immediate entry was imperative in light of the clear risks of an unchecked fire to public safety, not merely the Complainant’s safety but also others present in the area.SO#1 andSO#2 indicated in theirSIUinterviews that they fired their weapons believing it was necessary to protect themselves and others against an axe attack by the Complainant. By all accounts, the Complainant was advancing in a determined fashion, axe in hand, when the first series of shots rang out. Some of the eyewitnesses in the area described the Complainant’s disposition as angry. While the manner in which the Complainant held the axe was the subject of conflict in the evidence, some witnesses indicating that it was in one hand, and others saying that he held it in both hands in the fashion of a baseball bat, most if not all witnesses were of the view that the Complainant was wielding the axe as a weapon. In the circumstances, I accept that the officers’ stated apprehensions were genuine and reasonable at the time of the initial volley of gunfire.I further accept that the first series of shots bySO#2 andSO#1 constituted a reasonable response by the officers in defence of themselves and others in the vicinity. By that time, the Complainant had neared to within two to four metres of the officers notwithstandingSO#1’sCEWdeployment and the officers’ repeated commands that he stop and drop the axe.The question is raised whether the officers, having backtracked a distance away from the home as the Complainant advanced on their position prior to the shooting, could have continued their retreat rather than shooting when they did. Perhaps, but I am not persuaded they were derelict in failing to do so. Certainly, withdrawal or complete disengagement was not a realistic option. There were many people in the vicinity of the home, including firefighters who had responded to the fire call, which would have given rise to a legitimate concern for their safety. Nor did the officers have the luxury of time to scan the area around them to see where others were located exactly; their attention, understandably, was squarely focused on the Complainant.Finally, with respect to the numbers of shots that were fired – four bySO#2 and four to six bySO#1 – the evidence indicates that these occurred at about the same time and in relatively rapid succession. There does appear to have been a slight pause that marked a first and second set of shots bySO#1 in this series, but I am satisfied the gap does not make a material difference in the reasonableness analysis ofSO#1’s conduct. The evidence indicates that the Complainant was standing throughout the initial volley of gunfire, and even moved forward a short distance before falling to the ground after the final shot. In the circumstances, and given the fraught nature of the moment in which events unfolded, I am unable to reasonably impute any material difference in the officers’ apprehensions of the threat level and the reasonableness of their conduct throughout the first volley of shots.Once the Complainant was on the ground following the first volley of gunfire, he was shot again bySO#1.[4]Here, too, I am satisfied thatSO#1’s conduct was cloaked in the protection of section 34 of the Code.There is some dispute in the evidence as to the precise movements of the Complainant andSO#2 in the moments before the shot or shots. While most witnesses indicated that the Complainant was felled by the initial volley of gunfire, some had him on his knees whenSO#2 moved in to attempt to physically disarm him, others had him lying on the ground. In addition, in some witness accounts,WO#1 discharged herCEWat the Complainant beforeSO#2 made contact with him. In other accounts, theCEWdeployment is said to have occurred whileSO#2 and the Complainant were physically engaged on the ground.What is clear, however, is that the Complainant still had the axe in his right hand on the ground, that a furtherCEWdischarge and physical intervention bySO#2 had been unsuccessful in dispossessing him of the axe, and thatSO#2, apparently affected by theCEWdischarge, had rolled off the Complainant and was lying beside him whenSO#1 fired his gun. In the circumstances, I am unable to dismissSO#1’s assertion that he shot the Complainant in order to protectSO#2 from an imminent axe attack. In the heat of the moment, and in the split-second he had to make a decision, it seems to me thatSO#1’s apprehensions were honestly and reasonably held. That conclusion is, in my view, undisturbed whetherSO#1 discharged his firearm once or up to three times given there is no suggestion of any interruption in the rapidity of the shots or that the Complainant dropped the axe any earlier than after the last shot.Though I am satisfied there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against either subject officer, the Complainant’s death was tragic, made more so by his mental health at the time. The Complainant had struggled with mental illness for many years. On the day in question, he was very clearly in acute mental distress in the hours leading to the confrontation with the police. What he needed, more than anything, was medical attention. That, however, was not going to be possible unless immediate steps were taken to reach the Complainant, who in his altered state of mind had locked himself in his home and was refusing to come out with a small fire burning in the kitchen. In the circumstances, I cannot fault the officers for forcing the door open when they did. Nor am I able, for the foregoing reasons, to come to a reasonable belief that the officers were criminally responsible for the train of events that followed.Date:	November 23, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1006

,Peel Regional Police,Grey,Ontario,Paramedics were summoned to the scene and transported the Complainant to hospital where he was treated for serious internal injuries,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  In the case of lethal force, section 25(3) further provides that such force is not justified unless the officer believes on reasonable grounds that it was necessary for her or his self-preservation or the preservation of any one under their protection from death or grievous bodily harm.  On the record developed by theSIU, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO’s resort to lethal force fell outside the limits of legal justification.At the outset, I readily accept that theSOwas engaged in the lawful execution of his duty when he rushed to the scene of a reported bank robbery and confronted the Complainant with a view, presumably, to protecting the public and arresting the Complainant.  Based on the information he had been provided by a citizen leaving the Mississauga Chinese Centre and what he would have seen as he entered the front doors of the bank, namely, a masked person carrying a backpack full of cash and a firearm in his right hand, theSOhad every reason to believe that the Complainant was robbing the bank, constituted a real and immediate danger to the lives and safety of everyone around him, and was subject to lawful arrest.I am also satisfied that there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that theSO’s mindset at the time he fired the shot fell afoul of the legal requisites.  Since theSOchose to exercise his legal right to remain silent in the face of theSIUinvestigation, I am without direct evidence regarding the officer’s state of mind.  However, the circumstances in this case are telling.  Take first the Complainant’s conduct prior to the officers’ arrival in the bank.  The evidence establishes that the Complainant had terrorized upwards of ten bank employees.  He jumped up and down desks beside the teller counter, shouted angrily demanding money, invaded the personal space of the employees behind the teller counter and in their offices, and pointed his firearm directly at several of these persons and threatened their lives.  While theSOwould not have been privy to this conduct, the violence with which the Complainant pursued his purpose lends credence, in my view, to what likely was a genuine concern on the part of the officer of imminent death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of the Complainant.Consider also the situation in and around the time of the shooting.  While none of the bank employees witnessed the actual shooting, many of them heard the officers yell words to the effect of, “Freeze,” “Put your hands up,” and, “Don’t move,” shortly before they heard a single gunshot.  The video evidence, coupled with witness accounts, suggests the Complainant ran toward a wall and series of offices west of the client desks and teller counter as the officers entered the bank.  This evidence aligns with the rendition of events proffered byWO#3.  The officer, behind and to theSO’s right as they entered the bank and turned to their left toward the Complainant, indicates that the Complainant moved toward and away from the officers at close range a number of times in this location before he again moved in the officers’ direction and was shot by theSO.WO#1 is less explicit about the Complainant’s movements around the time of the gunshot.  He, and theSOandWO#3, according toWO#1, were standing in a semi-circle formation in front of the Complainant when he heard a gunshot.  On the weight of the evidence, the Complainant had the firearm in his right hand the whole time, dropping it only after he was shot, and still standing, for fear that he would be shot again if he made any movements with the gun.On the foregoing record, I am unable to conclude with any degree of confidence that theSOwas bereft of a reasonable belief that it was necessary to shoot the Complainant in order to protect his life and those around him from an imminent risk of death or grievous bodily harm.  On the contrary, I am inclined to believe that theSOhonestly and reasonably harboured such a belief when he fired his weapon.  The fact that the Complainant’s firearm was not, in fact, loaded, is of no consequence.  It was an actual firearm which theSOwould have had every reason to believe was loaded and ready to be fired in the hands of the Complainant.  Nor was retreat or withdrawal a realistic option.  The officers, including theSO, would have known that bank employees were in and around the area.  Their health and safety would clearly have been imperilled had the Complainant, seemingly armed with a working firearm, been left unattended in the bank.  The speed with which events unfolded also foreclosed any opportunity for disengagement by the officers.  Mere seconds had elapsed from the moment they entered the bank to the confrontation with the Complainant.Special note must be made of the fact that the Complainant was shot in the middle of the lower back.  Gun shots to the back are problematic in that they can suggest the subject of the wound was facing away from the shooter and therefore not a threat at the time of the gunfire.  Having scrutinized this piece of evidence, I am satisfied it does not deprive theSOof justification under section 25(3) of the Code.  It is clear on the evidence that the Complainant was failing to comply with police commands that he remain still and, in fact, was moving at the time of the shooting.  To reiterate,WO#3 described the Complainant moving back and forth a few times before he was shot.  I am also mindful of the fact that bank employees were present in various locations throughout the bank at the time, including in the direction that the Complainant would have been facing if he was standing with his back to theSOat the time the officer decided to shoot.  Given the immediate risk posed to the life and limb of persons present in the vicinity of an individual armed with a firearm, the Complainant’s movements and the reaction time inherent between the decision to fire and the actual gunshot, I am unable on the totality of the evidence to reasonably conclude that the Complainant was not a threat warranting a resort to lethal force because of the location of the wound in his back.In the result, as I am not satisfied there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSOacted unlawfully in shooting the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with charges against the officer and the file closed.Date:	January 4, 2021Joseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=1130

,Brantford Police Service,Brantford,Ontario,n r\n On November 21 2019 the SO of the HPS’s High Enforcement Action Team HEAT received information that the Complainant was in possession of a stolen motor vehicle  a Ford 350 pickup truck As a result of an unrelated investigation by the SO into the criminal activities of the Complainant he was aware that the Complainant had been court ordered as a result of a condition of his judicial release from custody on outstanding charges to reside with his father in his residence on East Avenue South in the City of Hamilton The SO attended a parking lot near the residence where he located the stolen motor vehicle The SO then contacted WO 1 another member of HEAT but from a different division of the HPS to assist him in surveilling the pickup truck and arresting the Complainant should he take possession of the stolen motor vehicle At approximately 5:00 p.m the SO and WO 1 observed the Complainant exit the building and approach the stolen truck The SO waited until the Complainant made actual physical contact with the truck before moving in to arrest the Complainant as he wanted to ensure that the Complainant was in possession of the truck The SO observed the Complainant approach the truck and while standing at the driver’s door attempt to gain access to the vehicle At that point the SO formed the necessary grounds to believe that the Complainant was in possession of stolen property and he therefore had the necessary grounds to place him under arrest During the course of arresting the Complainant the SO took him to the ground resulting in the Complainant sustaining a broken clavicle.\n,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=816

,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,The investigation also benefitted from a review of CEW data the police communications recordings and the post-mortem examination report,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.  I am satisfied thatSO#2,SO#1 andSO#3, were within their rights in attempting to take the Complainant into custody.  They had been called to the scene based on reports that an intoxicated Complainant was causing a disturbance in the neighbourhood by his boisterous outbursts.  Arriving in the area,SO#2 observed the Complainant on Riverspray Crescent across from a plaza and tried to speak with him.  The Complainant ignoredSO#2 and instead made his way into the backyard of his residence.SO#2 was unaware that the Complainant lived at the address, and was understandably concerned about the Complainant’s intentions.  On this record, the officers had cause to apprehend the Complainant on the basis of a legitimate worry about a breach of the peace.  The issue turns to the propriety of the force in the course of their interventions.Though there is no doubt that significant force was used against the Complainant, I am satisfied it was not unlawful.  Of particular concern is the firstCEWdischarge by eitherSO#1 orSO#3, delivered at a time when the Complainant had placed himself on the floor of the backyard deck.  I accept that the Complainant continued to flail his arms at this time and refused to place them behind his back as directed.  Might not the officers have been better advised to simply move in to attempt to take physical control of the Complainant before resorting to a weapon?  Perhaps.  However, allowance must be made for the fact that police officers embroiled in potentially volatile situations need not measure the nature and extent of their force with precision.  The law affords them a degree of latitude; what is required is a reasonable response, not necessarily an exacting one:R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 SCR 206;R. v. Baxter(1975), 27 CCC (2d) 96 (Ont. CA).  By the time of the firstCEWdischarge, the Complainant had given the officers reason to believe that he was intoxicated, intruding onto private premises, and unwilling to surrender peacefully to arrest given he continued to flail his arms and refused to place them behind his back as directed.  The Complainant was also a big man and it would not have been an easy matter to overpower him in the event he offered resistance.[5]On this record, I am unable to conclude with any confidence that the firstCEWdischarge fell outside the range of what was reasonably necessary in the moment to aid in the Complainant’s apprehension.What followed was an intense struggle between the officers and the Complainant.  After the firstCEWdeployment, the Complainant regained his footing and lunged atSO#2, who took evasive action by moving off the deck a short drop onto the ground below.  A furtherCEWdischarge occurred about this time, which appears to have temporarily incapacitated and felled the Complainant.  With little success,SO#3 andSO#1 attempted to control the Complainant’s arms asSO#2 stood on top of the Complainant’s legs to keep them from flailing.  Although there is no witness testimonial to this effect, it may well be thatSO#1 and/orSO#3 also struck the Complainant during this time with their arms or legs given the presence of bruising on the Complainant’s torso and arms.  The Complainant showed incredible strength and was able to ward off the officers’ efforts.  Again, the officers resorted to theirCEWs.  While it remains uncertain exactly in what order the discharges occurred, the data downloaded from theCEWs indicate thatSO#2,SO#1 andSO#3, fired their weapons five, five and two times, respectively.  The Complainant’s fight, however, remained unabated; the discharges seemingly had no effect on him.[6]Lastly,SO#2 drew hisOCspray and directed a blast toward the Complainant’s head.  Moments later, the officers were able to handcuff the Complainant behind his back.Here, too, the evidence falls short of reasonably establishing that excessive force was used against the Complainant.  It is apparent on the accounts of the three witnesses to the struggle who provided evidence to theSIU- one subject officer and two civilians - that the Complainant proved a formidable physical challenge to the officers.SO#2 described the Complainant as being in a frenzied state and believed he was in the throes of excited delirium.  According to the officer, the Complainant needed help given his behaviour and it was imperative that he be apprehended quickly. With respect to the number ofCEWdischarges, it is important to note that none of them appeared to sufficiently immobilize the Complainant, if at all, to permit the officers to secure him in restraints.[7]Moreover, these were delivered over a short period of time in the course of which each officer was reacting independently in the heat of the moment to the exigencies at hand.  The same, in my view, may well be said of any blows that might have been struck bySO#1 and/orSO#3 at this time.[8]As for the pepper spray, it appears to have been used only after repeatedCEWdischarges had failed to subdue the Complainant.  In these circumstances, there is insufficient evidence in my view to reasonably conclude that the force used by the officers following the initialCEWdischarge fell afoul of the limits prescribed by the criminal law.The pathologist described the cause of the Complainant’s death in the following terms:The cause of death is sudden death in a prone, restrained, agitated, morbidly obese man with blunt injuries in the setting of struggle, conducted electrical weapon (CEW) and oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray deployment. The mechanism of death was most likely a fatal cardiac arrhythmia. The cause of this man’s death was multifactorial in nature, with possible contributions of his agitated state, the interaction with police, including blunt injuries, his restraint, his prone position in the context of morbid obesity, and the perimortem deployment ofCEWs andOCspray.While I am satisfied on the foregoing analysis that the force used by the officers was not unlawful, the pathological evidence raises issues of potential negligence that must be assessed in the criminal liability analysis. For example, following the Complainant’s arrest, he was left in a prone position with his hands restrained behind his back for a period of time before losing vital signs and the commencement ofCPR.  In addition, the evidence suggests that the Complainant was in mental distress at the time of his confrontation with the police, raising the question of the propriety of the police response in relation to an individual who was not of sound mind.Turning first to the Complainant’s mental illness, the evidence indicates that he suffered from schizophrenia and was on medication to treat his condition.  The evidence further indicates that the Complainant was a regular user of cannabis and that his ingestion of the drug often led to flare-ups of psychotic behaviour.  According to the witness evidence, the Complainant started acting strangely after consuming cannabis at about 11:30 p.m. of November 19, 2019.At the time of the events in question,PRPhad a Crisis Outreach Assessment Support Team, orCOAST.  EachCOASTunit pairs a plainclothes officer with a mental health professional, who are available to respond to calls on a 24-7 basis.COASTis a method by which the police service seeks to respond more effectively to calls for service involving persons experiencing mental health crisis or emotional distress.  However, pursuant to thePRPpolicy in effect at the time,COASTunits are not mobilized unless the following four conditions are met: the call involves someone 16 years of age and over who is experiencing a mental health issue; the call is not of an emergent nature; there are no weapons involved in the call; and, the situation is calm.COASTwas not deployed in response to this call.  Ought it have been?The offence that arises for consideration in light of these issues iscriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  Simple negligence will not suffice to give rise to liability under the provision.  What is required, in part, is conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  On balance, I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that the subject officers were criminally negligent in the manner in which they, first, approached the Complainant and, second, treated him after his arrest.It is understood that placing a highly agitated, obese individual in a prone position with arms restrained behind their back may be associated with a risk of adverse health outcomes.  In his autopsy report, the pathologist recognized this contingency even while acknowledging the conflicting evidence in the literature regarding the relationship between the prone position and deaths in custody.  The subject officers would have done well to re-position the Complainant so that he was no longer prone on the ground promptly after he was handcuffed.  That said, though it remains unclear precisely how long the Complainant was in the prone position, the evidence suggests that it was no longer than a minute or two.[9]Moreover, within this period of time, there is no indication that the Complainant was ostensibly in acute medical distress until about the time thatWO#2 arrived on scene, noticed what he described as “agonal” breathing and a foamy substance in and around the Complainant’s mouth, and took steps to place him on his back.   Thus, while even fractions of time are of the essence in these cases, it would not appear that the Complainant was prone on the ground for any protracted period of time. In the circumstances, while I find that the subject officers on scene may not have acted as quickly as they could have to remove the Complainant from the prone position after he had been handcuffed, their lapses fall short of constituting a marked and substantial deviation from a reasonable level of care.WhetherCOASTshould have been deployed and whether it would have made a difference is arguable.  On the one hand, none of the information provided to the police service at intake would have necessarily suggested that this was a case involving someone having a mental health crisis.  The call came in largely as a noise complaint involving an inebriated individual.  And the police were unaware of any cautions suggesting the Complainant was mentally ill.  Certainly, nothing along those lines was conveyed to the officers who were dispatched.  On the other hand, one wonders whetherSO#2, having arrived at the scene and observed the Complainant’s odd and non-responsive behaviour, might have had an opportunity to ask for the deployment of mental health resources.  What must be borne in mind, however, is that things moved quickly from the moment the officer first encountered the Complainant to when the Complainant walked into the backyard of his residence.  In the circumstances, the officers had reason to believe they needed to intercede quickly in light of what they perceived, reasonably in my view, to be an emergent risk to the safety of the home’s occupants.  In view of these considerations, I am unable to find fault with the failure to mobilizeCOASTin this event, nor does it appear thatCOAST, had it been deployed, would have made a difference given the speed with which events unfolded.In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that there is insufficient evidence to reasonably conclude that the subject officers acted other than lawfully in their dealings with the Complainant, whether in the force they used to assist in his arrest or via the manner in which they approached him before and after the struggle that marked his arrest.  Accordingly, though the Complainant’s death was doubtless a tragedy, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Stone Mills,Ontario,xa0 r\n\xa0 nCause of Death nThe post-mortem examination determined that the cause of the Complainant’s death was “gunshot wound of torso,"Whether considered pursuant to the frameworks set out in section 25(3) or 34 of theCriminal Code, the first setting out the test for legal justification in the case of lethal force used in the execution of a police officer’s duty, the other outlining the parameters of force that is excusable in defence of oneself or another, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSO’s conduct did not run afoul of the limits prescribed by the criminal law.  The Complainant, with a potentially lethal weapon in hand, chose to run at theSO.  TheSO, on the other hand, continually moved back and away from the Complainant, initially getting out of the ditch and onto the roadway and then, when the Complainant continued to advance on theSO, moving behind his police cruiser for cover.  Throughout the Complainant’s advance on theSO, theSOcontinually directed the Complainant to stop and drop his weapon.  Finally, when theSOhad no place else to go, he discharged his firearm at the advancing Complainant.  One or both of the first volley of two shots struck the Complainant but failed to incapacitate him.  He kept moving toward the officer wielding the bat in a threatening fashion as the officer let off a second volley of gunfire consisting of six shots.TheSO, in his interview withSIUinvestigators, indicated that he fired his weapon fearing for his life and that he acted pursuant to his training when dealing with an armed attacker.On the aforementioned record, I accept that theSOgenuinely and reasonably believed that shooting the Complainant was necessary to protect himself from loss of life or grievous bodily harm. The officer was confronted by an individual threatening him with a dangerous weapon at close range.  While the officer continually retreated from the Complainant, and attempted to take cover behind his police vehicle, when the Complainant continued to advance on him, he left theSOwith no other options for a safe retreat.  TheSOfound himself alone, without backup, and facing an armed attacker with no recourse for further retreat. By the time the Complainant had moved around the police cruiser to the side where theSOhad sought refuge, the Complainant was placing himself within striking range of theSO, who then decided to discharge his weapon.  TheSOhad a difficult decision to make and split seconds in which to make it.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOwas within his rights in choosing to fire his firearm at the Complainant.It should be noted that theSOwas in possession of aCEWat the time, raising the question of its potential use to neutralize the threat posed by the Complainant.  By the time the Complainant emerged from his vehicle wielding a bat menacingly at theSO, the threat confronting the officer had instantly become potentially lethal in nature.  Moreover, theSOdid not have the benefit of a partner with him, in which scenario one or the other officer could have drawn theirCEWwhile the other unholstered their firearm.  In the circumstances, I am unable to fault theSOfor not first resorting to hisCEWgiven the threat level and the speed with which events unfolded.  Nor do I believe that the number of shots fired by theSOmakes any difference in the liability analysis.  While the Complainant appears to have been struck by one or more of the first two shots, he was not felled by either of them and continued to advance toward the officer bat in hand.  With respect to the second volley of six shots, I am unable to infer any material difference in the threat level theSOwould have reasonably apprehended across shots three through eight given the rapid succession of the gunfire and the volatility of the situation.  In arriving at this conclusion, I have in mind the common law principle that officers caught up in violent encounters are not expected to measure their countervailing force with precision; what is required is a reasonable response, not an exacting one:R. v.

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,They removed two CEW probes from SO 1’s left leg and took the Complainant to hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken nose and rhabdomyolysis,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were authorized or required to do by law.SO#1 andSO#2 were clearly acting within their rights when they engaged the Complainant physically to take him into custody.  Given what they knew of what had occurred betweenCW#2 and the Complainant, the Complainant was subject to lawful arrest for a number of offences, including assault.  The issue turns to the propriety of the force used bySO#1 andSO#2 when the Complainant reacted violently to his pending arrest.It is a principle of the common law that police officers embroiled in violent confrontations need not measure their use of responsive force with precision; what is required is a reasonable response, not an exacting one:R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 SCR 206;R. v. Baxter(1975), 27 CCC (2d) 96.  I am unable to reasonably conclude thatSO#1 andSO#2 ran afoul of the latitude prescribed by the criminal law in their dealings with the Complainant.  The Complainant proved a formidable challenge as the officers attempted to overcome his resistance.  Over the course of several minutes, he managed to keep both officers and two security members at bay as they wrestled with him to gain control of his hands and counter his aggression.  In the course of that struggle, the Complainant threw punches at the officers and flailed his arms and legs, at one point kickingSO#2 in the face, at another, dispossessingSO#1 of hisCEWand deploying it against the officer.  On the aforementioned record, I am not persuaded that the force used by the officers as they grappled with the Complainant to overcome his resistance, andSO#1 shocked him with hisCEWin drive-stun mode, exceeded the bounds of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to effect the Complainant’s arrest.  In arriving at this conclusion, it should further be noted that there was no direct evidence to indicate that either subject officer struck the Complainant during the confrontation, nor was there any evidence of any force being used against the Complainant after he was handcuffed.While I accept that the Complainant broke his nose in the course of his arrest, there is a possibility raised in the evidence that it was one of the security officers who caused the injury.  Moreover, there is some evidence suggesting that theCEWthat was used against the Complainant caused or contributed to the onset of rhabdomyolysis in the Complainant.  Be that as it may, as I have no reasonable grounds to believe thatSO#1 andSO#2 acted other than lawfully throughout their interaction with the Complainant, there is no basis for criminal charges against either officer, and the file is closed.Date:	April 27, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=733
,Hamilton Police Service,Brantford,Ontario,r\n\nCause of Death nA post-mortem examination performed on the Complainant’s body on November 11 2019 determined the cause of death to have been a contact perforating through-and-through gunshot wound to the head,"Whether the Complainant had intended to take his own life prior to the arrival of police, or whether he decided to do so only after he became aware of the presence of police, is unknown. What is clear, however, is that no police officer was in his room at the time of the shooting, nor did any police officer discharge a firearm at any time.While the impetus for the Complainant’s taking his own life may well have been the fact that he had been discovered by police, that does not weigh against the involved police officers, who were clearly carrying out their lawful duties in attending and potentially arresting an alleged double-murderer. It was the Complainant himself, acting of his own accord, who chose to end his life rather than to face the police. It appears, on all of the evidence, that theWOand the members of theWO’s team acted with prudence and exercised all due care and caution in not entering the Complainant’s room until all members of the public had been removed from harm’s way, and only then, after the tactical robot had established that the Complainant did not pose a threat to the police officers present, entering the Complainant’s room.On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theWO, or any member of theWO’s team, caused or contributed to the Complainant’s death by any want of care.

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,The Complainant was later treated at hospital for gunshot wounds to his right shoulder blade his right forearm and his left thigh,"The only evidence contradicting that outlined above indicates theSOapproached the passenger side of the Complainant’s vehicle and pointed a firearm at him. The Complainant told theSOnot to shoot him.  At that very moment, the drive-thru attendant directed the Complainant through the speaker at the menu board, to drive forward, as a result of which he did.  There was a gunshot and the Complainant immediately stopped his vehicle. He had been struck by a bullet. This evidence also indicates the Complainant did not have a firearm with him at the time of this incident.This evidence is implausible in respects and materially inconsistent with the reliable evidence gathered in this matter bySIUinvestigators, and I am therefore unable to accept this version of events.  For example, it is the dubious that the Complainant would drive forward because he was directed to do so by the Tim Hortons’ employee, despite a fully uniformed police officer pointing a firearm at him and yelling at him to get out of the car.  As is the indication that the Complainant did not have a firearm with him, which is contradicted not only by the presence of the firearm in the driver’s side footwell, but also by the evidence ofCW#3, the 911 caller, who observed the Complainant get out of the white Infinity and point a firearm at him.  Moreover, the suggestion the Complainant brought his vehicle to a stop when there was a gunshot is contradicted both by theCCTVfootage and by the fact that he was observed to come to a stop only when he collided with the cement post.Whether considered pursuant to the frameworks set out in section 25(3) or 34 of theCriminal Code, the first setting out the test for legal justification in the case of lethal force used in the execution of a police officer’s duty, the other outlining the parameters of force that is excusable in defence of oneself or another, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the conduct of theSOdid not run afoul of the limits prescribed by the criminal law.  TheSOwas acting pursuant to his duties when, following a 911 call received by the communication centre, and being aware that the driver of a white Infinity had pulled a firearm against another motorist in what was described as a ‘road rage’ incident, he carried out an investigation when he came upon the described vehicle in the area where the reported incident had occurred.  It is clear that when theSOandWO#5 exited their police vehicle and approached the white Infinity with their firearms drawn, they were acting in the course of their duties in that they were investigating the 911 caller’s complaint. Additionally, as the information received indicated that the driver of the Infinity was in possession of a firearm which he had already pointed at another civilian, it would have been imprudent and dangerous forSOandWO#5 to approach the Infinity without their weapons at the ready.In theSO’s interview withSIUinvestigators, he indicated that when the Complainant reached for a firearm and raised it in a firing position, theSOfeared for his own life, as well as that ofWO#5 and the employees of the Tim Hortons.  I accept that theSO, when faced with a man holding a firearm raised in his direction, genuinely and reasonably believed that shooting the Complainant was necessary to protect both himself, and those around him, from loss of life or grievous bodily harm.I do not accept that theSOonly discharged his firearm after the Complainant began to drive away from him, but rather, as supported by the reliable evidence, that theSOdischarged his firearm when the Complainant raised his firearm in the officer’s direction.   I draw no negative inference from the fact that theSOcontinued to discharge his weapon when the Complainant simultaneously began to drive forward.  As the shots appear to have occurred in quick succession, I am unable to meaningfully infer any material difference in the threat level that theSOwould have reasonably apprehended in such a volatile and highly-charged situation.  In arriving at this conclusion, I am mindful that the law does not require perfection of officers confronted with having to make split-second decisions in dangerous situations; what is required is a reasonable response, not an exacting one:R v Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 SCR 206;R v Baxter(1975), 27 CCC (2d) 96 (Ont. CA).On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO, while under a legitimate apprehension that discharging his firearm was necessary to protect his own life, and those around him, from a lethal threat, acted unreasonably in so doing notwithstanding the significant injuries incurred by the Complainant.  As such, as there is no basis to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed by theSO, no charges will issue and this file is close.Date:	March 30, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=679

,Ontario Provincial Police,Grey,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital and treated for three gunshot wounds to his right arm,"Under section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do. Where the force in question is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, the immunity will not attach pursuant to section 25(3) unless the officer reasonably apprehends that it was necessary to use such force to preserve oneself or another under his or her protection from death or grievous bodily harm. At the outset, I note that there were, in my view, lawful grounds to arrest the Complainant based on offences he had committed in various Ontario jurisdictions.In his interview with theSIU, theSOexplained that he fired his weapon believing it was necessary to thwart an imminent risk of death or serious injury to him and his fellow officers from the continued operation of the Mercedes sedan. I have no reason to doubt that theSOwas honestly of that view at the time he resorted to gunfire. The real question revolves around the reasonableness of the officer’s belief. On this question, one looks to an objective assessment of the relevant circumstances at the time.By the time shots were fired, the Complainant had made it clear that he had no intention of surrendering peacefully. While some evidence suggests that the Complainant believed he was being accosted by a street gang, feared for his safety, and attempted to flee, I am unable to accept this evidence as revealing the Complainant’s true interpretation of events. Other evidence reveals that his passenger, similarly situated, was immediately aware of the fact that their vehicle was being surrounded by police officers. One can only conclude that the Complainant, fully cognizant of several police officers in the vicinity of the Mercedes sedan, had little qualms about placing their lives in danger as he repeatedly rammed the police truck in front of him in a frenzied effort to escape. And risk their lives, I am satisfied, he did. In fact, on one occasion when he rammed the Mercedes sedan into the police pickup in front of him, the force of the collision pushed the rear end of the truck into theSO’s left leg. In this regard, it is telling that other officers surrounding the Mercedes sedan as it repeatedly struck the truck in front of it also believed their lives and the lives of their colleagues were in peril. On this record, I am satisfied that theSO’s apprehension of the danger that existed and the necessity of a resort to lethal force were reasonable in the circumstances.It might be suggested that theSO, rather than remain in close proximity to the Mercedes sedan as it rammed the police truck in front of him, ought to have retreated to a position of cover. In hindsight, it might well be accurate to say that there were opportunities for the officer to distance himself from the immediate dangers being created by the Mercedes sedan. However, I am unable to fault theSOfor failing to do so in the heat of the moment. In the split seconds in which theSOwould have had to calculate his actions, he was faced with a full-sized sedan violently striking a police vehicle in front of him with the ever-present possibility that it might break free from the blockade and barrel down on him or other officers as it fled the scene. In the circumstances, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOacted without legal justification when he aimed and fired his firearm at the vehicle’s operating mind to stop it. Nor am I able to say that the five shots let off by the officer were excessive. Given the rapidity with which they were discharged over a brief moment in time, I am unable to discern any meaningful difference in the threat level that theSOwould have reasonably apprehended from shots one through five.In the result, as I am satisfied that theSO’s resort to lethal force meets the stringent test for legal justification, there is no basis for proceeding with charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	May 11, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=759

his notes The investigation further benefitted from a review of data downloaded from a CEW discharged during the incident and video footage of parts of the arrest captured by a police drone Shortly after 11:00 a.m on September 23 2019 members of an OPP TRU team were mobilized to deal with a situation in the Town of Ingleside at an address on Dafoe Road Local OPP officers had earlier that morning attended at the address to arrest the Complainant for mischief to public property Upset at the township over a municipal grievance the Complainant had intentionally dug up the roadway in front of his home Greeted with profanity the sound of a shotgun being racked and a threat by the Complainant that he would not be taken alive the officers had left the property in the interests of everyone’s safety OPP Emergency Response Team officers were then deployed to surround and contain the property pending the arrival of the TRU Within an hour of being notified of the incident the TRU team were further advised that the Complainant was holed up in his residence with a gun and refusing to come out The OPP set up a command post near the intersection of Dafoe and Aultsville Roads From that location the TRU team commander and a couple of Critical Incident Commanders developed a plan whereby the TRU team would approach the property in an ARV first stopping to clear several outbuildings on the Complainant’s land before proceeding to the house Two snipers would also be set up in the outbuildings to monitor the Complainant’s movements in and out of the home reporting their intelligence to the other team members via radio SO 2 was the team leader With him were WO 6 – a dog handler with his dog WO 7 whose role it would be to discharge his CEW if necessary SO 1 tasked with wielding an

having been successfully cleared the ARV approached to within several metres of the front of the Complainant’s residence From that position with the use of the vehicle’s loudhailer WO 4 WO  8 and WO 1 the latter two in English and French repeatedly directed the Complainant to disarm himself and exit the home with his hands up Their entreaties were ignored as were WO 4’s efforts to attract the Complainant’s attention by periodically activating the vehicle’s emergency lights and siren One of the two snipers WO 2 reported that he could see the Complainant seated in the kitchen holding a long gun As the standoff continued the officers decided to deploy a throw phone next to the front door of the home in the hopes that the Complainant would collect the phone and use it to speak with police He did not A distractionary device was set off outside the home at about 3:22 p.m but it too failed to elicit a response from the Complainant At about 3:48 p.m with officers in and out of the ARV the Complainant emerged from the front of his home He was holding a loaded shotgun and walking toward the front of the ARV Multiple officers ordered the Complainant to drop his firearm and put his hands in the air to no effect As the Complainant continued forward SO 1 from a position in front of the Complainant fired his ARWEN multiple times The Complainant was struck dropped his shotgun and fell to the ground At SO 2’s direction WO 6 quickly released his dog who bit onto the Complainant’s lower right leg The Complainant kicked the dog away with his left foot and made it to his knees before his left arm area was bit by the dog The Complainant was on his knees with his torso bowed forward when WO 7 approached to within a metre or two of the Complainant and discharged his CEW into the

,Kingston Police,Armour,Ontario,The preliminary finding following the post-mortem examination of the Complainant concluded that the cause of death was stab wounds to the neck and a gunshot wound to the torso,"Pursuant to section 25(3) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for lethal force used in the course of their duties provided they reasonably believe such force is necessary to protect oneself or a third-party under their protection from death or grievous bodily harm.  On the record in this case, I have no difficulty in finding that theSO’s use of lethal force against the Complainant was legally justified.  For whatever reason, the Complainant was on a violent rampage. Knife in hand, with a 20-centimetre blade, he had viciously attacked an innocent civilian – now deceased – and was in the middle of stabbing another –CW#16 – when theSOarrived on scene at the intersection of Queen and Bagot Streets.  The Complainant was obviously subject to lawful arrest.The officer quickly appreciated what he was up against.  He drew his firearm and ran toward the Complainant’s location on the northwest corner of the Queen and Bagot Streets intersection.  He ordered the Complainant to get on the ground and then pursued him as he fled westward away from the slumped body ofCW#16, whom he had just stabbed with the knife.  The officer kept pace with the Complainant, who re-entered the intersection and chased after another civilian with the knife in hand.  The civilian was fortunate to get away, at which point the Complainant proceeded north along the west sidewalk of Bagot Street north of Queen Street, before suddenly changing course and moving toward the officer.  TheSOdemonstrated restraint as the Complainant closed the distance between them.  He moved backward on the sidewalk and discharged his firearm once at the Complainant at close range just before stepping off the sidewalk onto the roadway.  The Complainant continued to move toward theSObut soon retreated toward the northwest corner of the intersection again where, with a number of officers now confronting him, he started to stab himself with the knife.  Following twoCEWdischarges, the Complainant was apprehended, whereupon the officers attempted life-saving measures.On the aforementioned record, it is clear that the Complainant was on the cusp of launching a knife attack on theSOwhen the officer fired his weapon.  It is also clear that theSOhad no other option if he was going to preserve himself from a potentially lethal attack. In the result, while it appears that the gunshot wound the Complainant sustained, in combination with the knife wounds he self-inflicted, contributed to his death, I am satisfied that theSOacted lawfully throughout his engagement with the Complainant.  Indeed, in addition to protecting himself, the officer’s interventions are likely responsible for preventing the Complainant from having killedCW#16 and inflicting grievous if not mortal harm toCW#17.

,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,The CEWs likely did not play a major role if any in his death,"There are two matters to be considered with respect to the officers’ potential criminal liability in relation to their involvement in the incident that culminated in the Complainant’s death. I will first address whether the degree of force used during the apprehension was lawful. Secondly, I will turn to whether the level of care exercised by the officers in their dealings with the Complainant was substandard and, if so, whether it was sufficiently so to ground criminal liability.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are restricted in the force they use to that which is reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they are required or authorized to do. The subject officers were lawfully in the execution of their duties when they attended and entered the Complainant’s house in response to two phone calls to police from family members inside, including a 911 call. In my view,SO#2 provided the Complainant with sufficient opportunity to engage with him without force being used and the officers only resorted to force when his behaviour suddenly turned threatening. Prior to their arrival,SO#2 andSO#1 were aware that the Complainant might be high on drugs and had had a physical altercation with his brother. He did not followSO#2’s direction, while displaying agitated and aggressive behaviour. The officers were in an unfamiliar, confined and volatile environment. One of the main duties police have under the common law is to protect and preserve life. The officers discharged theirCEWs, first in an attempt to protect themselves when he suddenly ran towardsSO#2, and subsequently to control and apprehend the Complainant whose behaviour made him a potential danger to himself and others.By all accounts, the initialCEWdeployments bySO#1 and subsequent deployment bySO#2 did not incapacitate the Complainant and he continued to be combative. He was in an agitated state, struggling and not following the officers’ directions. He struck, perhaps inadvertently,SO#2 with his arm. Even after being handcuffed, the Complainant continued to yell and struggle with the officers on the ground. The officers had to continue to hold him down in order to keep him under control until the paramedics arrived. No additional use of force options were employed. In the stated circumstances, I am satisfied that the level of force resorted to by each of the subject officers was measured and reasonably necessary in order to apprehend the Complainant for his safety and the safety of others, and furthermore for assaulting his brother andSO#2.With respect to the level of care observed by the officers in their dealings with the Complainant, the offence for consideration is criminal negligence causing death contrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code. Liability for the offence is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances. While I am troubled by the evidence suggesting the Complainant was held prone on the ground for some period of time prior to the paramedics’ arrival, I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that the subject officers’ conduct amounted to a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of the Complainant.The officers seem to have been aware of the dangers associated with placing an agitated prisoner in a prone position. Multiple lines of evidence, including the statements ofSO#2 and theWO, indicated that the subject officers specifically took steps to ensure that the Complainant was placed on his side, pending the arrival of the ambulance, to facilitate his breathing. This evidence stands in conflict, however, with other lines of evidence, according to which the Complainant was being restrained on his stomach by the officers when the paramedics arrived on the scene. While I am unable to make a definitive finding on this issue given the relative strength of the competing versions of events, there is at the very least a reasonable basis to conclude that the Complainant did spend a portion of the time on the ground in the prone position after he was handcuffed and prior to the paramedics’ arrival.The Complainant’s position on the ground in the prone position carried with it a level of risk and may have played a role in the death. As the pathologist at autopsy concluded, the fact that the Complainant was handcuffed behind the back and in the prone position “likely” played a role in his death if he lost consciousness prior to being rolled over and unrestrained. If unconsciousness set in after the handcuffs were removed and he was rolled over, their role, though less clear, “may also” have contributed to the Complainant’s death.Setting aside the issue of when precisely the Complainant lost consciousness, the fact that he may have been restrained and in a prone position for longer than he arguably ought to have been is not the end of the reasonableness analysis. The Complainant had proven a formidable physical challenge to the officers’ efforts to control him. On the one occasion they attempted to sit him up in a seated position, he thrashed about and kicked his legs wildly. In the circumstances, while it may be the officers might have exercised greater care by opting to avoid placing the Complainant in the prone position altogether, their possible failure to do so must be understood in context. It should also be noted thatSO#2 requestedEMSsoon after the Complainant’s apprehension. Five minutes later, theWOradioed that a rush be placed on the ambulance, which would eventually arrive on scene at about 9:30 p.m. Finally, as soon as paramedics determined the Complainant’s vital signs were absent, bothSO#1 andSO#2 immediately assisted with efforts to resuscitate him.In the final analysis, it remains unclear on the evidence whether and to what extent the role of restraints and the prone position caused or contributed to the Complainant’s death. Be that as it may, while it may be that the subject officers acted unreasonably in placing the Complainant in a prone position for any length of time given his highly agitated state at the time, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officers’ indiscretions, weighed in the balance with the totality of the evidence, rendered their conduct a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.[3]The Complainant’s death was a tragedy. However, for the foregoing reasons, there is insufficient evidence in my view to reasonably conclude that the level of force resorted to by the involved officers fell outside the range of what was lawful or that the level of care they exercised was so substandard as to attract criminal sanction. Accordingly, there are no reasonable grounds to proceed with criminal charges and this file is closed.Date:	November 16, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=994
,Hamilton Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario,Upon arrival at the police station it was determined that the Complainant required medical assistance and he was transported to the hospital where he was diagnosed as having sustained a fractured hip,"There is no doubt that some force was used by theSOto stop the Complainant from escaping; however, there is no evidence that this force was excessive. Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, a police officer, if he or she acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  On a review of the record before me, it is clear that theSOwas acting in the lawful execution of his duties when he pursued and apprehended the Complainant, who was wanted on an outstanding arrest warrant.  Furthermore, as the Complainant was running directly toward the live lanes of traffic on Centennial Parkway North, it would have been incumbent upon theSOto stop the Complainant as quickly as possible before the situation became unsafe, not only for the Complainant, but for the motorists on the roadway.  While it is unfortunate that the Complainant injured his hip when he was taken down by theSO, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the force used by the officer was unreasonable given the need to apprehend a fleeing the Complainant, and to do so quickly before he ran into live lanes of traffic.In the result, as I am satisfied that theSOacted lawfully throughout his dealings with the Complainant, there is no basis to proceed with criminal charges in this matter and the file is closed.Date:	April 20, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=713

The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  On a review of the record, there is little if anything in the conduct theSOthat gives cause for concern and I am satisfied that the manner in which theSOoperated his police vehicle fell at all times within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.TheSO’s speed was minimal throughout his engagement with the Equinox, topping out at 25 km/h, well below the posted speed limits on Fairford Avenue and Woodfield Road.  He stopped at all controlled intersections and maintained a safe distance well back of the vehicle he was following at all times.  In the circumstances, it cannot be said that he unduly pushed the driver of the Equinox; on the contrary, the officer left the driver sufficient space and opportunity to reduce his speed and adopt a safer course, had he been so inclined.  Would it have been advisable to refrain from following the Equinox at all?  Perhaps.  After all, the reason for the intended stop was anHTAoffence.  Be that as it may, this singular indiscretion, if it be such, was certainly not enough in the circumstances of this case to amount to a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care.In the final analysis, in the context of theSO’s very brief engagement in time and distance with the Equinox, notable for the officer’s careful driving throughout, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges, and the file is closed.Date:	April 21, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=725

,Niagara Regional Police Service,Lincoln,Ontario,The SIU’s investigation into the circumstances surrounding the Complainant’s injuries consisted of interviews with the Complainant the SO and the WO,"It should further be noted that there were no other motorists on the roadway and, therefore, theSO’s maneuver did not endanger or interfere with traffic on Silver Street.Finally, the question of whether theSO’s motor vehicle moved slightly forward while the Complainant was attempting to pass, thereby nudging the Complainant’s motorcycle and causing the collision or if it was the collision that caused theSO’s foot to be dislodged from the brake pedal and the cruiser to move forward after the fact of the collision remains unanswered. Since the police cruiser was not fully engaged in the collision, no crash data was generated by the vehicle and it is therefore impossible to know, with any degree of certainty, whether it was fully stopped or moving slowly at the time it was struck by the Complainant’s motorcycle. There is evidence, however, that undermines the reliability of the evidence suggesting that theSOdrove his cruiser into the Complainant’s path. For example, the evidence suggesting theSOmoved his vehicle into the Complainant’s path also suggests that the Complainant never applied his brakes or skidded as he approached the police vehicle; however, this is directly contradicted by the single curved tire mark along the south side of the eastbound lane, curving toward the driveway entrance, which was clearly made by the Complainant’s motorcycle as he braked when approaching theSO’s police vehicle. In the circumstances, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOintentionally drove his cruiser into the path of the motorcycle.In the final analysis, given theSO’s very brief engagement with the Complainant in which the officer safely positioned his vehicle ahead of the Complainant’s path of travel in order to deter his continued flight from police and effect his lawful apprehension, I am satisfied that the officer did not transgress the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

Nor did the officer put undue pressure on Complainant #2. In fact, the evidence indicates that theSOwas at all times a fair distance behind the Audi, allowing Complainant #2 every opportunity to reduce his speed and adopt a safer course. Indeed, theSOhad abandoned any attempts to stop the Audi before it crashed.In the final analysis, in the context of theSO’s short-lived engagement in this matter, notable for his brief pursuit of the Audi at high speeds that was quickly terminated, I have no reasonable grounds to believe that the officer either caused or contributed to the collision in question, or otherwise drove dangerously in violation of theCriminal Code.

Liability for the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  I can find nothing in the manner in which theSOoperated his cruiser that is subject to criticism.  On the contrary, his conduct appears at all times to have been prudent, well-considered, and in the best interests of the public and the safety of all users of the roadway, including the Complainant himself.  While the Complainant continued to operate his motorcycle in the same manner which had initially drawn theSO’s attention, there is no evidence that the driving of the Complainant was in any way influenced by the actions of theSO.  In fact, I am unable to determine if the Complainant was ever even aware that theSOhad engaged his emergency lighting system and made a U-turn with the intent of performing a vehicle stop.In conclusion, as there is no reason to suspect that theSOdrove his cruiser other than responsibly with due care and regard for traffic around him, including the Complainant, there is no basis to proceed with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	April 6, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=693

The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances:R v Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49. I am satisfied that the manner in which theSOoperated his police vehicle fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.It is unclear whether the officer contravened O Reg 266/10, the regulation governing police pursuits in the province. That regulation defines a “suspect apprehension pursuit” as a situation in which the officer has attempted to direct the driver of a vehicle to stop, the driver refuses to obey the officer, and the officer pursues the vehicle for the purposes of stopping it or identifying the vehicle or a person in the vehicle. TheSIUis without direct evidence of theSO’s intentions at the time; as was his right, he declined to be interviewed by theSIU. That said, the speed with which theSOfollowed the pickup truck suggests he was set on stopping the vehicle. On all the evidence, one arguably has the existence of a “suspect apprehension pursuit”. The point is an important one as O Reg 266/10 prohibits suspect apprehension pursuits unless the officer believes that a criminal offence has been or is about to be committed, or there is a need to identify the vehicle or someone in the vehicle. It is unclear whether either of these criteria existed at the time. Certainly, there is nothing on the record to indicate there were any grounds to believe theCWor his passengers had committed or were about to commit a criminal offence.Whether theSOwas engaged in a legitimate suspect apprehension pursuit under the regulation is also important for another reason. Pursuant to section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act, speed limits to do not apply to police vehicles being used in the lawful performance of a police officer’s duties. The evidence is clear that theSOreached speeds in excess of twice the speed limit as he travelled east on Fanshawe Park Road West after the pickup truck. If, in fact, theSOwas not in the performance of his lawful duty, because he was engaged in a pursuit when he ought not have been under the regulation, then his speeds would weigh more heavily against him in the liability analysis.On the other side of the ledger, theCCTVfootage establishes that the police cruiser did not appear to be accelerating as aggressively as theCW’s motor vehicle, which is likely why theSOcontinued to lose ground with the gap between the two vehicles increasing from nine (on Fanshawe Park Road West) to 16 seconds (on Louise Boulevard). Moreover, while theSO’s speed on Fanshawe Park Road West was significant, there were no other motor vehicles or pedestrians on the road due to the time of day, and theSOat no time endangered the lives of others while driving at these speeds.Finally, there is no suggestion that theSOwas putting undue pressure on theCWto continue to drive at the excessive rates of speed at which he was travelling. On the contrary, theCWhad every opportunity to reduce his speed and adopt a safer course had he been so inclined.In the final analysis, in the context of theSO’s short-lived efforts to catch up to, and possibly attempt to signal the F150 to pull over, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the manner in which the officer operated his cruiser ran afoul of the criminal law’s proscriptions, notwithstanding the speeds he reached during his engagement with the Complainant. Consequently, there is no basis for proceeding with charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	April 6, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=681

,London Police Service,London,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital where he was treated for his burns,"Pursuant to s 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided that such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law. The officers were clearly in the exercise of their duties when they responded to calls that the Complainant was threatening to kill himself. The common law makes clear that protecting life is an officer’s foremost duty.Notwithstanding their ineffectiveness in this case, I am also satisfied that the use of theBIPlaunchers fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances. Arriving on scene within minutes and quickly ascertaining that the Complainant was carrying a gasoline cannister and a lighter, the officers contained the scene in a semi-circle around the Complainant and directed that he drop what he was holding.SO#1, a trained negotiator with theLPStactical team, took the lead in speaking with the Complainant. Those negotiations took place over about five minutes and came to a halt when the Complainant gestured as if he was about to light himself on fire. At that point,SO#1 ordered that theBIPlaunchers be deployed.SO#2 andSO#3 did so, discharging three rounds each at about the same time. Unfortunately, although the Complainant was struck, he was able to pour more gasoline on himself and set himself on fire with his lighter.The officers had given the Complainant every opportunity to cease course and only resorted to their weapons when the Complainant’s self-immolation appeared imminent. Had they worked as intended, theBIPshots would have disarmed the Complainant of the dangerous items in his possession or sufficiently incapacitated him to allow the officers to move in, without the infliction of serious injury. On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude thatSO#2 andSO#3 used excessive force.The question remains whether there was anything more the police could have done to prevent the Complainant harming himself. If so, and the police were sufficiently remiss in failing to pursue those measures, it might well be there are reasonable grounds to believe one or more of the officers committed the offence of criminal negligence causing bodily harm contrary to section 221 of theCriminal Code. In my view, there is clearly no basis for proceeding with charges along these lines. The officers responded quickly to the scene, set up containment around the Complainant to prevent others from being placed at risk, and attempted to resolve the situation peacefully through for several minutes. Given the volatility of the situation, the officers had good cause to approach the Complainant with great caution and from a distance while the situation permitted, and then proactively in the discharge of theirBIPweapons to try to prevent the Complainant from setting himself on fire as soon as it appeared he was about to do so. Thereafter, the officers and other first responders on scene acted quickly to douse the flames and secure medical treatment for the Complainant. On this record, I am satisfied that the officers acted professionally and with full regard for the Complainant’s health and wellbeing throughout the brief standoff.In the final analysis, as I am satisfied that the officers acted lawfully throughout their dealings with the Complainant, there is no basis for proceeding with charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	March 30, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=666
,Brantford Police Service,Brant,Ontario,The Complainant sustained multiple gunshot wounds resulting in severe injuries,"WhenSO#2 initially arrived at the Polish Hall at about 10:20 a.m., he parked near the Complainant’s van, in which the Complainant was seated.  Prior toSO#2 exiting his police vehicle, the Complainant is seen on theCCTVfootage exiting his van, approaching the officer’s vehicle, peering inside, and then going back to his own vehicle and re-entering it.  Moments later,SO#2 is seen to exit his vehicle and approach the Complainant, in his van, and they appear to be having a discussion.SO#2 is then seen to walk toward the back of the Complainant’s van and speak into his shoulder-mounted radio.  It was at this time, at 10:26 a.m. as confirmed by the communications log, thatSO#2 voiced his concerns about the Complainant and requested another officer attend for backup.SO#1 responded.At 10:30 a.m.,SO#2 broadcasted over the police radio that the Complainant had exited his van and had a knife.The Complainant walked towardSO#2, with a knife in hand, whileSO#2 yelled at him to drop the knife.  The Complainant failed to do so and was met with aCEWdischarge fromSO#2’s weapon.The data retrieved fromSO#2’sCEWindicate that it was discharged twice at about 10:30 a.m., each time for a period of five seconds.The Complainant fell to the ground, where he remained momentarily before again standing up.SO#1 arrived at the Polish Hall and was seen to run toward the Complainant with his firearm drawn.  BothSO#1 andSO#2 yelled at the Complainant to put the knife down.SO#2 holstered hisCEWand drew his firearm, which he pointed at the Complainant.  When the Complainant refused to drop the knife and continued to approach, both officers discharged their firearms.  The Complainant fell to the ground but retained the knife in his right hand.SO#1 andSO#2 continued to yell at the Complainant to drop the knife.  TheCCTVfootage revealed the Complainant then lying on the ground and holding the knife to his own throat.  Additional officers arrived at the scene andWO#5 was seen to walk toward the Complainant, step on his right forearm with his right foot, grab the knife from the Complainant, and throw it away; a second officer was then seen to kick it further out of reach.Two bloodstained folding knives, each with a blade of about 7.5 centimetres, were subsequently recovered from the scene.Based on the facts that the Complainant had little, if any, recollection of events that occurred after he exited his vehicle and that his behaviour was described as peculiar, bizarre, and erratic, I can only deduce that the Complainant was suffering from some type of mental health crisis at the time of this incident.The details not seen on theCCTVfootage, or established by other independent evidence, were filled in by the two subject officers.SO#2 advised, in his statement toSIUinvestigators, that when he initially approached the Complainant seated in his vehicle, the Complainant askedSO#2 to help him.  The Complainant then told him that there was an unknown vehicle parked in his driveway,[5]which had scared the Complainant, resulting in his vomiting and defecating in his pants.  WhenSO#2 asked the Complainant if he had taken any medication or illicit substances, the Complainant advised the officer that he had eaten some leftovers.  The Complainant’s odd behaviour causedSO#2 to become nervous, and he stepped back and requested the attendance of another police officer.  The Complainant then exited his vehicle with a knife in his hand andSO#2 transmitted this information over the police radio.  When the Complainant began to walk towardSO#2, the officer retreated while simultaneously yelling at the Complainant to drop the knife.  The Complainant then retrieved a second knife from his pocket and he pointed both knives upward, as he walked towardSO#2.SO#1 arrived on scene asSO#2 pointed hisCEWat the Complainant and repeatedly directed him to drop the knives. The Complainant continued towardSO#2, coming within approximately three metres of the officer, andSO#2 deployed hisCEW, resulting in the Complainant falling to the ground.  Within moments, however, the Complainant got back up with both knives still in his hands.SO#2 deployed hisCEWat the Complainant a second time, with the Complainant again falling to the ground, before almost immediately trying to get up for a second time.SO#2 then kicked the Complainant’s left arm with his foot, trying to get him to comply, but the Complainant continued to hold both knives as he began to get up.SO#2 placed his left foot on the Complainant’s head to try and hold him down, as a result of which the Complainant tried to strike atSO#2’s right foot with the knife.SO#2, believing that the Complainant had struck his foot with the knife, backed away from the Complainant attempting to create some distance between them.  WhenSO#2 was approximately three metres from the Complainant, the Complainant stood up and continued his approach onSO#2 with the two knives in his hands. When the Complainant was approximately two metres fromSO#2,SO#2 discharged his firearm.InSO#1’s interview withSIUinvestigators, he advised that when he arrived at the parking lot of the Polish Hall, he observedSO#2 backing away from the Complainant, following whichSO#2 deployed hisCEWresulting in the Complainant falling to the ground while still holding onto a knife.SO#1, who was standing approximately one and a half metres from the Complainant, then also deployed hisCEW, but it appeared to have no effect; the Complainant began to wave the knife aggressively and refused to comply with the officers’ repeated demands to drop the knife.SO#1 proceeded to draw his firearm, which he aimed at the Complainant, while he too retreated in order to create distance between himself and the Complainant.  When the Complainant got up, with the knife still in his hand, and began to aggressively close the distance between himself andSO#2,SO#1 feared that the Complainant was going to injure or killSO#2, and he discharged his firearm at the Complainant.The Complainant immediately fell to the ground but continued to hold a knife in his right hand, while both officers yelled at him to drop the knife.  The Complainant waved the knife above his head, following which he began to poke at his own head with the knife.SO#1 told the Complainant that they could help him if he would drop the knife and they pleaded with him to do so.  Both officers continued to train their firearms on the Complainant, until other officers arrived andWO#5 removed the knife from the Complainant.WO#1 later observed a second knife lying nearby.Whether considered pursuant to the frameworks set out in section 25(3) or 34 of theCriminal Code, the first setting out the test for legal justification in the case of lethal force used in the execution of a police officer’s duty while the other outlining the parameters of force that is excusable in defence of oneself or another, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the conduct of bothSO#1 andSO#2 did not run afoul of the limits prescribed by the criminal law.It is clear that whenSO#1 andSO#2 attended to the parking lot of the Polish Hall, they were acting in the course of their duties in that they were responding to a 911 call for assistance from the Complainant.  Thereafter, as soon as the Complainant exited his vehicle and it became obvious that he was armed with a knife, and then two knives after retrieving a second knife from his pocket, the officers were clearly acting within the scope of their lawful duties to protect and preserve life, and to investigate and take appropriate action in relation to the Complainant’s possession of dangerous weapons.InSO#1’s interview withSIUinvestigators, he indicated that when the Complainant began to walk towardsSO#2, he feared that the Complainant might injure or killSO#2; this fear was shared bySO#2, who had been trying to convince the Complainant to put down his weapon, following which he twice deployed hisCEWin apparent attempts to stop the Complainant without having to resort to lethal force.  I accept that bothSO#1 andSO#2 genuinely and reasonably believed that shooting the Complainant was necessary to protectSO#2 from loss of life or grievous bodily harm.  It is instructive to note that both officers present, andSO#2 in particular, had drawn their sidearms in order to protect themselves when repeated directions to the Complainant to drop the knives went unheeded, and multipleCEWdischarges at the Complainant had proved ineffective in stopping the Complainant, who was armed, from bearing down onSO#2.On the aforementioned record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that eitherSO#1 orSO#2, each under a legitimate apprehension that discharging his firearm was necessary to protectSO#2 from a lethal threat, acted unreasonably in resorting to their firearms.  Accordingly, as there is no basis to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed by either police officer, no charges will issue and this file is closed.Date:	April 27, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=727

,Ontario Provincial Police,Barrie,Ontario,The cause of death was determined as “a gunshot wound to torso,"Throughout the pursuit,WO#4 adjusted his speed to suit traffic conditions; travelling at roughly 140 km/h on Hwy 115 when traffic was light and reducing his speed to 120 km/h when approaching and passing a group of vehicles.WO#4’s top speed – 180 km/h – is some cause for concern; however, I do not find this alone constitutes a marked departure from the requisite standard of care.WO#4 only reached this speed for a short duration, when he was not in the presence of other motorists and in an effort to close a gap between himself and the Mustang. Moreover,WO#4’s speed is also mitigated to some extent by section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act, which, while it does not provide an officer free rein to exceed the speed limit without regard for public safety considerations, does allow an officer to speed where she or he is in the lawful performance of duty.Furthermore,WO#4 continually reassessed whether he should terminate the pursuit having regard to public safety. For instance, in his interview with theSIU,WO#4 indicated that he considered whether to continue the pursuit after the Mustang drove into oncoming traffic at the roundabout at CR 21 and Hwy 28.WO#4 only continued the pursuit after noting that conditions were perfect – the weather was good, roads were dry and visibility was clear. He was also familiar with the area and cognizant that the road now consisted of long stretches.WO#4 explained that he made the decision to discontinue the pursuit when the Mustang turned suddenly onto the Sir Sandford Fleming Drive/The Parkway off-ramp, which was a more heavily trafficked area.WO#4 took his foot off the accelerator and followed closely behind the Mustang. ShouldWO#4 have refrained from following the Mustang at this point? Perhaps. However, I am unable to find this momentary indiscretion, if it be such, tips the balance in favour of a marked departure in the context of an otherwise appropriately conducted pursuit.I turn now to consider the lawfulness of the force used against Complainant #1 which ultimately resulted in his death. Whether considered pursuant to the frameworks set out in section 25(3) or 34 of theCriminal Code, the first setting out the test for legal justification in the case of lethal force used in the execution of a police officer’s duty, the other outlining the parameters of force that is excusable in defence of oneself or another, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSO’s conduct did not run afoul of the limits prescribed by the criminal law.  Complainant #1 was not of sound mind at the time of the events in question.  He was, at the very least, under the influence of illicit drugs and he was extremely distraught over his impending return to a custodial facility, as demonstrated by his referring to himself as a three time parolee who had nothing to lose and saying on multiple occasions words to the effect of “It ends here tonight, it’s over tonight, I’m not going back to jail”.  His state of mind was further demonstrated by his repeatedly putting the barrel of the gun under his chin, with threats that he was going to kill himself, and possiblyCW#6, and his demands for the police to shoot him.  Additionally, police were aware that Complainant #1 andCW#6 were alleged to have been involved in several violent armed robberies with firearms.  Furthermore, as soon asWO#4 approached the vehicle, it became obvious that Complainant #1 was in possession of a lethal weapon.  Knowing all this, the police officers surrounding the Mustang were clearly acting within the scope of their lawful duties to protect and preserve life, and to investigate and take appropriate action in relation to Complainant #1’s possession of a stolen motor vehicle and a firearm.In theSO’s interview withSIUinvestigators, he indicated that when Complainant #1 exited the Mustang with the firearm, he feared for the life of his fellow officers, as well as his own; this fear appears to have been shared by the other officers present, includingWO#3, who had been tirelessly trying to convince Complainant #1 to put down his weapon and to end this incident without the loss of life.  I accept that theSOgenuinely and reasonably believed that shooting Complainant #1 was necessary to protect both himself, and his fellow officers, from loss of life or grievous bodily harm.  In fact, it had been agreed in advance among the officers present that if Complainant #1 exited the motor vehicle with the firearm, they would consider him a grave and lethal threat to both the community at large, and the police officers present in particular, and that theSOwould then have to shoot Complainant #1. In this context, it is instructive to note that other officers present, who were similarly situated at the time, had also drawn their sidearms in order to protect themselves, opting not to shoot because of the possibility of crossfire and the direction given that it was to be theSOwho was to take the shot. On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO, under a legitimate apprehension that discharging his firearm was necessary to protect himself and his fellow officers from a lethal threat, acted unreasonably in so doing notwithstanding the resulting and tragic loss of life.In the result, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	June 8, 2020Electronically signed byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=826

,Ontario Provincial Police,Essex,Ontario,n r\n The following events emerge from the evidence collected by the SIU which included statements from the SO and three civilian eyewitnesses GPS data associated with the SO’s cruiser and the police communication recordings After querying the plate of the motorcycle being operated by the Complainant the SO observed the Complainant to turn left onto Manning Road and then right onto Amy Croft Drive each time at or below the speed limit The SO followed at a distance of approximately 250 to 300 metres Once the Complainant drove past the second entrance of the plaza on Amy Croft Drive the SO activated his emergency lighting system in order to signal to the Complainant that he wished him to stop The Complainant in turn began to accelerate and pull away from the SO The SO also accelerated and closed the gap between the two vehicles to approximately 50 to 60 metres at which point he activated his siren The SO had increased his speed to approximately 100 km/h and maintained that speed for a matter of seconds but when he saw the Complainant drive through a stop sign without stopping and around a vehicle attempting to make a left turn onto Amy Croft Drive from Commercial Boulevard the SO turned off his siren and pulled over to the curb to terminate the pursuit He was of the view that it was unsafe to continue to pursue the motorcycle as it was entering a residential area The SO radioed the dispatcher at 8:55 p.m and advised that a motorcycle had failed to stop for him When the communications sergeant queried whether the SO was in pursuit the SO confirmed that he was not and that he was parked This evidence is confirmed by the GPS data from the police vehicle operated by the SO CW 3 observed the Complainant drive through a stop sign at a four-way stop intersection without stopping and at a high rate of speed following which he was involved in a collision with a parked motor vehicle He called 911 at 8:57 hours and the call immediately went out over the radio causing the SO to respond Approximately two minutes later or almost four minutes after the SO reported that he had pulled over and stopped CW 3 reported that the first police officer was now arriving at the scene That officer was the SO According to the GPS data from the police vehicle operated by the SO while attempting to stop the Complainant his speed increased to 122 km/h while he was travelling on County Road 22 and to 118 km/h on Amy Croft Drive which speed he maintained for 10 seconds before slowing and finally coming to a full stop.\n,"The offence that arises for consideration in this case is that ofdangerous drivingcontrary to section 320.13(1) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  I am satisfied on balance that the manner in which the officer operated his police vehicle fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  At a speed upwards of 120 km/h, theSOwas traveling well over the speed limit.  That said, it bears noting that the officer quickly pulled to the shoulder and terminated the pursuit when it became clear to him that the Complainant was not going to stop for the officer.  The officer’s velocity is also mitigated to an extent by section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act.  While the provision does not provide an officer carte blanche to exceed the speed limit without regard to public safety considerations, it does allow an officer to speed where the officer is in the lawful performance of his or her duty.  TheSOwas clearly in the exercise of his duty at the time.  Furthermore, it should be noted that there is no indication that theSOever actually endangered, by the manner of his driving, any third-party motorists on either County Road 22 or on Amy Croft Drive. In fact, as soon as theSOobserved the Complainant to fail to stop at a stop sign, he determined that it would be unsafe for him to engage in a vehicular pursuit and he slowed and then pulled over to the side of the road.  TheSOhad only maintained his top speed of 118 km/h on Amy Croft Drive for 10 seconds before pulling over.Unfortunately, the fact that theSOabandoned his efforts to stop and investigate the Complainant for aHighway Traffic Actinfraction failed to alter the Complainant’s dangerous driving.  He continued to drive at extremely high speeds and without regard for the posted stop signs, until he eventually crashed into a parked motor vehicle causing his injuries. Ultimately, it appears clear that the Complainant crashed his motor vehicle as a result of his own reckless and dangerous driving, and therefore was the author of his own misfortune.In the final analysis, in the context of theSO’s short-lived engagement in this matter, notable for his brief pursuit of the motorcycle at high speeds, which was quickly terminated when theSOdetermined that it was unsafe to continue, I have no reasonable grounds to believe that the officer either caused or contributed to the collision in question, or otherwise drove dangerously in violation of theCriminal Code.Date:	March 30, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=672
,Ontario Provincial Police,Huron,Ontario,n r\n Following an investigation by SIU investigators which consisted of interviewing five civilian and two police witnesses including the complainant and the SO the following facts were established on the weight of the reliable evidence While hospitalized in 2018 the Complainant had injured his right shoulder On July 12 2019 the Complainant had fallen onto the floor in the kitchen of his home and was unable to get up His family was concerned that the Complainant had fallen as a result of a possible stroke and EMS were called to the home Upon the arrival of the paramedics the Complainant became belligerent and ordered the paramedics to leave his home The paramedics did so and then contacted police to attend The WO and the SO of the OPP attended in response to the call neither officer was made aware of the Complainant’s prior medical history Upon the arrival of police the Complainant was found to be lying on his stomach on the floor of the kitchen on his right side propping himself up with his left arm The Complainant ordered police to leave his home indicating that he wished to be left to die Due to the Complainant’s condition he was on the floor and could not get up and his threats of wanting to die the WO determined that the Complainant was unable to care for himself and would be apprehended under the MHA The WO informed the Complainant of his intention and then moved toward the Complainant and took control of his left wrist The Complainant resisted and the WO placed his knee onto the Complainant’s left leg following which the Complainant immediately stopped resisting and the WO placed the Complainant’s left hand behind his back The SO then assisted and took the Complainant’s right hand and attempted to place it behind his back in order to allow the Complainant to be handcuffed The Complainant immediately complained The SO then tried a second time and the Complainant complained again The SO commented that he had heard a popping sound As soon as the officers became aware that there was a problem they immediately stopped and the Complainant was then cuffed to the front and transported to the hospital There is no indication that any police officer at any time resorted to any other force against the Complainant.\n,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=664

,Ontario Provincial Police,Arnprior,Ontario,Her cause of death was listed as “Multiple injuries,"The offence that arises for consideration in this case is that ofdangerous drivingcontrary to section 320.13(1) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  I am satisfied on balance that the manner in which theSOoperated his police vehicle fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  At a speed upwards of 157 km/h, the top speed reached by theSOduring his aborted pursuit, the officer was traveling well over the speed limit.  That said, it bears reiterating that the officer quickly pulled to the shoulder and terminated the pursuit, when it became clear to him that Complainant #1 was not going to stop for the officer.  TheSO’s velocity is also mitigated to an extent by section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act, which, while it does not provide an officer free rein to exceed the speed limit without regard to public safety considerations, allows an officer to speed where he or she is in the lawful performance of duty.  TheSOwas clearly in the exercise of his duty at the time.  The same be said of the environmental conditions that prevailed at the time.  These were favourable – the weather was clear, and the roads were dry with at most moderate vehicular traffic – and would not have exacerbated the inherent risks associated with theSO’s speed.   Furthermore, it should be noted that there is no indication that theSOever actually endangered, by the manner of his driving, any third-party motorists on Hwy 417. In fact, as soon as theSOdetermined that his pursuit may well have been “pushing” Complainant #1, he immediately terminated and pulled to the shoulder.  Unfortunately, the fact that theSOabandoned his efforts and allowed Complainant #1 to flee, did not alter Complainant #1’s apparent goal of killing himself by intentionally causing a head-on collision with other motor vehicles, as evidenced by his deliberate action of entering into the westbound lanes of traffic and driving head-on into oncoming traffic.In the final analysis, in the context of theSO’s short-lived engagement in this matter, notable for his brief pursuit of the Honda at high speeds which was quickly terminated when theSOdetermined that it was unsafe to continue, I have no reasonable grounds to believe that the officer either caused or contributed to the collision in question, or otherwise drove dangerously in violation of theCriminal Code.Date:	March 23, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=668

,Toronto Police Service,Brighton,Ontario,The Report of Post-mortem Examination dated September 22 2019 confirmed the cause of death to be “gunshot wound of chest”,"Section 34 of theCriminal Codeprescribes the boundaries of justifiable force in the defence of oneself or another from an actual or threatened attack.  It requires that the defensive act be reasonable with reference to the relevant circumstances, including the nature of the force or threat, whether there were other means to protect oneself or another, and whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon.   I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOacted with the protection of section 34 when he discharged his firearm at the Complainant.At the time theSOfired his weapon,WO#5 had just been jammed against the Honda Accord by the forward movement of the Mercedes.  While I am inclined to believe that the Complainant drove forward intentionally in an ill-fated effort to escape the police blockade, I cannot discount the possibility that he did so unintentionally, an inadvertent reaction perhaps to the highly charged events unfolding about him with an officer –WO#3 – striking him in the hands and face from the front passenger seat.  Be that as it may, when the Mercedes moved forward andWO#5 screamed in pain, theSOwould certainly have apprehended, reasonably in my view, that his colleague was being attacked by the Complainant’s use of his vehicle.  Moreover, in the circumstances that prevailed, I have no reason to doubt that theSObelieved it was necessary in the moment to shoot the Complainant to thwart the Complainant’s attack and protect his teammate from an imminent risk of death or grievous bodily harm.  The issue is whether theSO’s resort to lethal force was reasonable in the circumstances.Needless to say,WO#5’s life and limb were in clear peril as the Mercedes collided with his lower half and pinned him against the Honda Accord.  The officer’s life hung in the balance with every second while he remained stuck in that position.  Resolute and prompt action was required to disable the Mercedes’ operating mind – the Complainant.  Just prior to the Mercedes’ forward movement,WO#1 had tried unsuccessfully to break the driver door window to get at the Complainant andWO#3, who had managed to remove the front passenger from the Mercedes, was inside the vehicle attempting to forcibly stop the Complainant from operating the car when the shots rang out.   Assuming theSOwas cognizant of what his teammates were doing, he might have opted to allow the officers to continue with these efforts asWO#5 was struck and pinned.  Alternatively, he could have re-entered his vehicle – the Honda Accord – and moved it forward to releaseWO#5 (as he did after the shooting).  However, as doing so risked precious additional time during whichWO#5 would remain in grave danger, I am not satisfied that these were realistic options in the circumstances.  In the final analysis, confronted with a clear and present risk to the life of a fellow officer, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO’s resort to lethal force was anything other than a commensurate, proportional and reasonable response to a lethal threat.  As for the fact that multiple rounds were fired by theSO, these occurred in such rapid succession that I am unable to infer any meaningful difference in the threat level the officer would have perceived across the three shots.In the result, as I am of the view that no reasonable grounds exist to believe that theSOacted outside the bounds of legitimate force under section 34 of theCriminal Codewhen he shot the Complainant, there is no basis for charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	March 9, 2020Original signed byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=660

,Ottawa Police Service,Champlain,Ontario,n r\n The material events in question are uncontested on the evidence gathered by the SIU and may be summarized in short order The SO while on patrol in an unmarked cruiser traveling east on Highway 417 stopped the Complainant operating a Toyota SUV in the area of Hunt Club Road The officer had performed a check on the vehicle and learned that its licence plate should be attached to an Infinity vehicle In fact the Complainant was driving a stolen vehicle As the SO exited his cruiser to approach the Toyota SUV the Complainant accelerated away eastward on the highway at high speed The SO returned to his cruiser and followed suit The pursuit continued at very high speeds east along Highway 417 for approximately 20 kilometres before the vehicles exited onto southbound St Guillaume Road The SO was joined on St Guillaume Road by WO 3 and WO 4 of the OPP responding to an OPS request for assistance who took positions behind the SO The pursuit continued another seven to eight kilometres at high speed until the Complainant failed to negotiate the roundabout at Highway 3 Notre Dame Street and rolled over The SO and WO 3 brought their cruisers to a stop at the roundabout and approached the Complainant in his vehicle The Complainant was removed from the wreckage arrested and taken to hospital n,"The offence that arises for consideration as far as theSO’s potential criminal liability is concerned isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, the crime is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  While there are aspects of theSO’s conduct throughout his engagement with the Complainant that are subject to legitimate scrutiny, I am unable to reasonably conclude on the totality of the evidence that he transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.While eastbound on Highway 417, theSO’s speeds were generally in excess of 180 km/h and topped out at about 190 km/h for a brief period.  On St. Guillaume Road, theSOreached a top speed of about 183 km/h.  Needless to say, these velocities, significantly over the 100 km/h and the predominantly 80 km/h speed limits on the highway and St. Guillaume Road, respectively, represented an inherent danger on the roadway.  That danger, and the overall risk to public safety that it represented, in my view, was exacerbated by the reason for the pursuit in the first place, namely, an improper licence plate and possibly stolen vehicle.  In other words, the Complainant was not wanted for some violent offence and in need of immediate apprehension to thwart an articulable risk to the public.  It was further exacerbated by what appears to have been the close distance the officer maintained with the ToyotaSUV, at least at points in the pursuit.  For example, the camera that captured a short snippet of the pursuit as it travelled south on St. Guillaume Road showed the cruiser about two seconds behind the Complainant.  Travelling as fast as they were, theSOleft himself little margin for error given the proximity of the vehicles.On the other hand, it bears noting that officers engaged in the lawful course of their duties are exempt from the speed limit pursuant to section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act.  Whether or not theSOwas in breach of the regulation that governs police pursuits in the province – O. Reg. 266/10 – he was ostensibly acting to enforce the law when he attempted to stop a stolen vehicle with improper licence plates.  In the circumstances, while the speed exemption does not give police officers free rein to speed as they wish without regard to public safety considerations, it is a mitigating factor in the criminal liability analysis.  The fact that Highway 417 and St. Guillaume Road were dry with little to no vehicles on them and there were few if any pedestrians in the vicinity of the pursuit further attenuates the dangers created by the speeding vehicles.  Thus, there is no evidence that the risks created by the speeds were reflected in any demonstrable danger having been visited upon a nearby motorist or pedestrian.  Finally, the record establishes that theSOupdated the communications centre with his speeds, traffic and road conditions, and direction of travel.  This allowedWO#1, with command over the pursuit, to make an informed decision about whether it should be called off.WO#1 was of the view that the pursuit could safely be continued right until the point of the collision, cautioning that theSOshould back off a distance with the approach toward the roundabout.  In fact, theSOreduced his speed markedly, from about 180 km/h to 140 km/h, as the pursuit approached the site of the collision.  There are two points to make from this.  First, while it may be that theSOfueled the Complainant’s reckless driving to an extent by maintaining a close distance between their vehicles, it cannot be said that he drove the Complainant into the roundabout given his significant deceleration as they approached the collision site.  Second, regardless of the merits ofWO#1’s decision, and acknowledging that theSOhad an independent duty to terminate the pursuit if the public was being placed at undue risk, the fact that the sergeant did not intervene militates in favour of theSO.In the final analysis, while theSOmay well have fallen short by operating an unmarked cruiser at very high speed over a protracted period of time for a property offence, I am not satisfied that his indiscretions were sufficiently wanting, weighed against the extenuating circumstances, as to markedly deviate from a reasonable level of care.  Accordingly, there is no basis for proceeding with charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	June 16, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=839

,Ontario Provincial Police,Essex,Ontario,r\n\nCause of Death nThe pathologist at autopsy attributed the Complainant’s death to a gunshot wound to the chest,"Whether pursuant to section 25(3) of theCriminal Code, which restricts an officer’s use of lethal force in the execution of an act which he or she is authorized or required to do by law, or section 34, setting out the ambit of legally justifiable force used in defence of oneself or another from an actual or threatened attack, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOacted lawfully when he shot the Complainant.  The former limits recourse to lethal force to situations in which an officer reasonably believes it is necessary to preserve oneself or another from death or grievous bodily harm.  The latter requires that the defensive force be reasonable in all the circumstances with regard to such considerations as: the nature of the force or threat; whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon; and, the nature and proportionality of the person’s response to the use or threat of force.At the outset, it bears noting what is readily apparent on the record, namely, that theSOwas engaged in the lawful execution of his duties when he responded to the 911 call and took charge of the police response to a highly volatile situation involving an armed man threatening to harm himself and others.  In the events that transpired over the course of about 40 minutes prior to the shooting, there is nothing to suggest that theSOacquitted himself other than professionally.  By all accounts, the officer did what he could to de-escalate the situation and achieve a peaceful resolution: he had a trained negotiator lead all communications with the Complainant; he consulted with the Complainant’s mother as to what might calm the Complainant and adopted some of her advice, at one point attempting to place the Complainant in touch with his brother; and, he preventedWO#4’s dog from entering the residence for fear that the dog’s barking might provoke the Complainant.  All the while, theSOensured the appropriate resources were in place to deal with various contingencies, such as armed conflict with the Complainant and resulting injury.  Needless to say, by the time of the shooting, the Complainant was clearly subject to arrest for his assaultive behaviour toward the officers.Of course, while theSO’s planning attests to his prudence in the police operation that regrettably ended in the Complainant’s death, the liability analysis is premised on his state of mind and the circumstances such as they prevailed at the time of the shooting.  TheSOdid not interview with theSIU.  However, in the notes he made of the incident, theSOsays that he discharged his weapon at the Complainant fearing his life to be in danger from an imminent knife attack.  I have no reason to doubt the authenticity of theSO’s proclaimed belief.By the time theSOdischarged his firearm, he had just seen and heard the Complainant wildly attackingOPPofficers armed with a pair of scissors and a knife, seriously injuring one of them –WO#5 – in the process.  RepeatedCEWdischarges, including two from theSO, had failed to achieve their intended effect.  Now confronted with the Complainant rising back to his feet, edged-weapons still in his possession and seemingly intent on injuring the officers, I am satisfied that theSO’s believed that his life was in imminent peril and that shooting the Complainant was necessary to protect himself from a lethal threat.  It should be noted that the Complainant was no more than two to three metres away from theSOwhen the shot was fired, and that retreat was neither readily available to the officer in light of the close quarters in which events transpired nor a realistic option given the risk the Complainant also posed to other officers in the vicinity at the time.Finally, based on the aforementioned record, I not only believe that theSOwas honestly of the view that shooting the Complainant was necessary, I further accept that the officer’s apprehensions were reasonable in the circumstances.  Put simply, faced with a mortal threat and only split seconds to decide what to do, I cannot find fault with theSO’s belief that he had to shoot the Complainant to protect himself from an imminent risk of death.In the final analysis, I am satisfied that theSOdid not resort to lethal force other than after the combined manpower of five police officers and repeatedCEWdischarges had failed to subdue the Complainant and then only as a final option, rendered necessary to thwart a real and present danger of death or grievous bodily harm.   Consequently, as I am of the view that theSOdid not act excessively or unreasonably when he discharged his firearm at the Complainant causing his tragic death, there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case against the subject officer and the file is closed.Date:	April 6, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=691

,Ontario Provincial Police,Grey,Ontario,Complainant 3 suffered a fracture to his left shinbone and left middle finger,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from a reasonable level of care; simple negligence will not suffice:R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49.  While theSO’s speed is certainly subject to scrutiny and perhaps even criticism, it fell short, in my view, of rendering the officer’s conduct a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  At twice the 60 km/h speed limit on Golf Links Road, I accept that theSO’s speed represented a danger on the roadway to other traffic in the area.  It was also a paramount factor in the accident that occurred.  Had the officer been driving at or near the speed limit, for example, the forensic evidence developed by theSIUsuggests Complainant #1 would likely have cleared the intersection and completed his turn before the arrival of the police vehicle.On the other hand, the impact of theSO’s speed in the liability analysis is mitigated by several considerations.  For starters, under section 128(13)(b), police vehicles used in the lawful performance of a police officer’s duties are exempt from the governing speed limits.  While theSOwas not responding to an emergency call for service, he was operating a police vehicle and engaged in abona fidetraining activity at the time of the crash; he was clearly in the exercise of official duties and therefore captured by the protection of the provision.  This is not to suggest that theSOwas free to speed as he wished without regard for public safety.  It does mean, however, that some allowance must be made for the officer’s speed as he was participating in a training exercise that reasonably contemplated occasional spurts of acceleration beyond the speed limit in order to keep pace with the subject vehicle.TheSO’s speed must also be understood in the context of what in other respects appears to have been safe and prudent driving on the part of the officer.  While the case law establishes that excessive speed alone may in the appropriate circumstances constitute dangerous driving (R. v. Richards(2003), 174 CCC (3d) 154 (Ont. C.A.)), the courts have also made clear their reluctance to base criminal liability for the offence on singular or isolated lapses in judgement:Beatty, supra.  The evidence indicates that theSOreached a top speed on Golf Links Road of 122 km/h for a short period of time before he started to decelerate in advance of Complainant #1’s left-turningSUV.  There is no suggestion in the evidence of any other indicia of dangerous driving or protracted speeding in the manner with which theSOwas operating the police vehicle.Another important part of the context were the surrounding conditions at the time of the incident.  The roadway was dry and in good repair, the weather was clear, visibility was good, and vehicular traffic was light to moderate in what was a semi-rural stretch of roadway lined with a number of businesses and a hospital on one side of the road.  There was a sign warning northbound motorists of a construction zone up ahead and the need to merge into a single lane.  However, as the sign was only 200 metres or so before the collision site and the construction zone was well north of the incident scene, I am not persuaded that this factor tips the liability analysis one way or the other.  On this record, I am satisfied that the risks inherent in the speeds at which theSOtravelled north along Golf Links Road were not unduly exacerbated by the environment around him.In the final analysis, when one weighs the totality of the evidence on both sides of the ledger, I am unable to reasonably conclude on balance that theSO’s conduct, and his speed in particular over a stretch of road under 400 metres in length, was so wanting in the circumstances that it transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  Consequently, there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges against the officernotwithstanding his role in the collision that resulted in injuries to his partner on the day, Complainant #3, and to Complainant #1 and Complainant #2.

,,Guelph,Ontario,n r\n The following scenario arises from the weight of the evidence collected by the SIU The Complainant was lodged in Cell 6 of the OPS station just before midnight on June 1 2019 She had been arrested by the SO in a basement apartment in Orangeville at about 11:20 p.m of June 1 2019 The SO together with WO 1 WO 2 and WO 3 had arrived at the residence in support of paramedics and firefighters responding to a drug overdose call The Complainant had called 911 to report the overdose While at the scene the SO ran a check on the Complainant learned that she was wanted on an outstanding arrest warrant and took her into custody The SO transported the Complainant to the police station arriving at about 11:30 p.m She was paraded before WO 2 and asked a series of questions In response to inquiries about alcohol and drug consumption the Complainant acknowledged having consumed a bottle of wine a quantity of beer prescription medications and crack cocaine At WO 2’s direction the SO proceeded to search the Complainant by having her pull her clothing away from her body and shake it out presumably to allow any hidden contraband to fall The Complainant was also asked to pull up her dress so the SO could visually inspect her underwear When she demurred arguing that a female officer should search her WO 2 explained they were allowed to search her and would not “feel her up” The Complainant was lodged in Cell 6 at about 11:49 p.m She had been upset with her arrest believing it unfair as she had called 911 to help someone in dire need When advised while in custody by the SO that she would be held for a court proceeding in the morning the Complainant became incensed She began to kick and punch at the cell walls at one point striking her head against the wall At about 1:50 a.m the Complainant sat on the toilet pulled down her underwear and reached between her legs thereafter standing while holding a plastic bag with a white substance in it She began to inhale deeply from the bag At about 1:53 a.m she started licking the plastic wrap material As she ingested the material in the bag the Complainant repeatedly looked at the cell camera attempting to attract the attention of whoever might be monitoring the camera PEW who was tasked with monitoring the Complainant observed the Complainant on a screen in another room licking the bag and went to speak with her The Complainant told him she had ingested cocaine He then saw her flush the plastic bag down the toilet Reporting what had occurred to officers in the Constables Room the PEW was advised by the SO to inform WO 2 WO 2 had left the station to resume his duties on the road as the platoon sergeant When contacted by the PEW WO 2 directed that the Complainant’s condition be closely monitored The Complainant’s behaviour deteriorated prompting the PEW to call WO 2 again she had removed her clothing was pulling at her hair and appeared panicked and delusional Back at the police station at about 2:14 a.m WO 2 observed the Complainant’s behaviour from the video monitoring room and decided to contact the paramedics That call was placed at about 2:19 a.m Paramedics arrived at the station at about 2:26 a.m The Complainant collapsed in their presence was loaded on a stretcher and rushed to hospital in an ambulance departing the station at about 2:42 a.m She arrived at hospital at about 2:47 a.m.\n,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=642

,Ontario Provincial Police,Hawkesbury,Ontario,The pathologist also determined “the deployment of a CEW played no part in his death whatsoever,"There are two issues that are raised with respect to the officers’ potential criminal liability in relation to the circumstances culminating in the Complainant’s death.  The first looks at the force that was used against the Complainant and asks whether it was excessive.  The second examines whether the care exercised by the officers in their dealings with the Complainant was substandard and, if so, whether it was sufficiently so to ground criminal liability.  I turn first to the propriety of the force used against the Complainant.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are restricted in their use of force to that which is reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they are authorized or required to do by law.  The Complainant was clearly of unsound mind and a threat to his safety and the safety of others when confronted byWO#1 andWO#2 in the apartment kitchen.  There is evidence that prior to the officers’ arrival he had assaulted someone and jumped from a balcony.  Upon seeing and hearing the Complainant,WO#1 andWO#2 deduced he was in the throes of excited delirium.  They tried to de-escalate his behaviour verbally but were unable to make any headway.  WhenWO#2 reached for the Complainant’s arm, concerned when he saw the Complainant reaching into his pocket, the Complainant reacted aggressively by swinging at the officer.  In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the Complainant was subject to apprehension under section 17 of theMental Health Act.I am further satisfied that the force used by the officers to take the Complainant into custody was lawful.  This included theCEWdeployments byWO#1 andWO#2 and, thereafter, the superior manpower used by the officers, includingSO#1 andSO#2, to wrestle control of the Complainant’s arms and secure them in handcuffs.  Given the Complainant’s violent and volatile behaviour, the officers acted reasonably in seeking to incapacitate him from a distance with theirCEWs.  Thereafter, there is no indication that the officers used anything other than moderate force in handcuffing the Complainant; there is no evidence, for example, of any strikes being delivered.  All four officers, it would appear, also used force to control the Complainant’s movements after he went to the floor just outside the bathroom.  This consisted of efforts to control the Complainant’s legs and head as he was kicking and spitting blood.  Again, the force in question appears to have been proportional to the task at hand.[2]On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the force used by the officers fell outside the latitude of permissible force in the circumstances.With respect to the level of care observed by the officers in their dealings with the Complainant, the offence that arises for consideration is failure to provide necessaries of life contrary to section 215(2)(b).  As an offence of penal negligence, liability under the provision is premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  There are aspects of the manner in which the Complainant was treated by the officers that are open to legitimate scrutiny.  For example, knowing as they ought to have known of the risks associated with positional asphyxia, particularly in a large individual, as the Complainant was, exhibiting signs of delirium, the officers nevertheless maintained the Complainant in a semi-prone position.  Their justification for doing so was apparently to avoid being spat on by the Complainant and potentially contracting a communicable disease.  There reason for not using a spit mask was that they wished to avoid further agitating the Complainant.  In hindsight, the officers might better have been advised to use the spit mask and re-position the Complainant given the risks associated with positional asphyxia.  That said, it is important to note that the paramedics were not insistent that the Complainant be re-positioned.  If the trained medical professionals on scene were not sufficiently moved to force the issue, then some allowance must be made for the officers’ judgement.  Moreover, once the Complainant lost vital signs after being sedated by the paramedics, the officers did what they could to assist the paramedics in rendering emergency medical care.  In particular,SO#1 appears to have assumed the lead role in administering chest compressions, which presumably were instrumental in re-establishing a heart beat in the Complainant.  When these considerations are weighed in the balance, I am not persuaded on reasonable grounds that the care exercised by the officers deviated markedly from the standard that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.The Complainant died tragically on May 10, 2019, the culmination of a medical event set in motion on May 2, 2019.  He was only 31 years of age.  As the results of his post-mortem examination make clear, the Complainant’s death was attributable to a drug overdose.  The focus of theSIU’s investigation was to determine whether there were reasonable grounds to believe the officers who dealt with him on May 2, 2019 committed a criminal offence in connection with his death.  As I am satisfied, both in terms of the force that was used and the care they exercised, that the officers acted lawfully throughout their involvement with the Complainant, I have no such grounds.   Accordingly, there is no basis to proceed with charges and the file is closed.Date:	February 18, 2020Original signed byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=658

The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that markedly deviates from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances:R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49.  While theSO’s conduct was not flawless, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that he exercised a level of care that fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law.  The officer was on duty and responding to a serious call for service involving potential violence at a hospital as he approached the Dixie Road and Williams Parkway intersection.  In compliance with subsection 144(20) of theHighway Traffic Act, which permits emergency vehicles to travel through a red light, theSObrought his cruiser to a stop with his emergency lights and siren operating before he entered the intersection.  Subsection 144(20), however, also requires that the driver of an emergency vehicle not proceed through a red light unless it is safe to do so.  I have no reason to doubt that theSObelieved it was safe to proceed when he did.  But for the Complainant, other motorists at the intersection appear to have taken heed of the officer’s presence and brought their vehicles to a stop before the officer continued northward.  That said, the collision itself suggests that it was not, in fact, safe to proceed at the time chosen by theSO.  He clearly did not see the Complainant until, perhaps, it was too late to avoid the collision.  It may well be that his sightline was obstructed by traffic stopped in the westbound left turn lane of Williams Parkway.  Indeed, the same traffic would have blocked the Complainant’s view of vehicles on Dixie Road approaching Williams Parkway from the south and she did not see the cruiser when she entered the intersection.  That is not offered as an excuse, but it may explain why the collision occurred and is arguably an extenuating circumstance in the liability analysis. Be that as it may, theSO’s driving behaviour was in other respects prudent in the moments leading to the collision.  After bringing his vehicle to a stop, he entered the intersection slowly after a period of time had elapsed during which he was actively scanning in all directions to ensure traffic around him had come to a stop.  Moreover, there is no indication of any dangerous driving in the time before he arrived at the intersection.  Nor was it the case that environmental conditions called for added care: the weather was clear, the roads were dry and in good repair, and visibility was good.  Weighed in the balance, theSO’s singular indiscretion, if it be such, of entering the intersection without it being safe to do so, is not sufficient in my view to render his conduct a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  Accordingly, there are no reasonable grounds for proceeding with criminal charges against the subject officer and the file is closed.Date:	July 17, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=379

,Brantford Police Service,Brantford,Ontario,The injury was described as a contact range wound with the entry on the right side of the head and the exit on the left,"The offence that arises for consideration iscriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that represents a marked and substantial departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  In the context of this case, the liability analysis essentially boils down to the following questions: Was there anything more that the officers could have done to prevent the Complainant’s self-inflicted death and, if so, were the officers so wanting in this regard that their conduct transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law?  I need only address the first question to resolve the matter as, in my view, it must be answered in the negative.The operational plan that was devised to locate and arrest the Complainant was sensible in design and prudent in its execution.  The Complainant was known from prior police contacts to be a violent man who was armed and dangerous following his suspected involvement in a homicide a week-and-a-half prior.  In the circumstances, the police were right to deploy specialized teams in tracking his location and effecting his arrest – theMSUand theERU.  They were also wise in waiting to confront the Complainant in the wooded area off the UPI gas station even though they had earlier tracked him to an apartment building on Morning Calm Drive.  The unit which the Complainant was visiting contained other persons, including children, whose safety would have been jeopardized had the police decided to act at that location.Having followed the Complainant to the UPI gas station and now set up around him as he tried to free his vehicle from a patch of mud, the officers waited and maintained a lookout for upwards of an hour.  Their caution was well warranted.  If the Complainant did have a firearm at his disposal, it behooved the officers to get as a good a read as possible regarding his intentions before making their next move while ensuring at the same time he remained contained.  When it appeared that the Complainant was preoccupied with extricating his vehicle and not by any outward indication aware of their presence around him, the decision was made at about 11:45 a.m. to adopt a more proactive posture.  By this time, theERUofficers were joined byWO#4 and her dog, an additional and important resource that would allow the police to engage the Complainant from a distance in the event he decided to resist arrest.  The Complainant did in fact resist arrest when the officers called out to him as they approached his location in the bush.  He ran from the officers in a southerly direction but was quickly caught by the dog;WO#4 had given the Complainant fair warning that she would release her dog if he did not stop and then did so when he continued to run.  On the weight of the evidence, the Complainant shot himself in the head just as the dog made first contact with him or immediately before.With the officers still watching from a distance,WO#4’s dog latched on to the Complainant’s right arm as he lay on the ground and shook it, dislodging a handgun from his right hand.  Realizing that the Complainant had sustained a head wound and required immediate medical attention, the officers approached the body without waiting for ballistic shields to be brought to the scene.  The officers did so at some risk to their own safety given that the Complainant was still breathing at this time and could still conceivably access the firearm.  Once at the Complainant’s side, the officers did what they could to render first aid at the scene while arranging to carry the Complainant out on a stretcher to paramedics waiting at a staging area.  Regrettably, the Complainant could not be saved and was declared deceased at hospital the following morning.On the aforementioned record, I am unable to find fault with the law enforcement exercise that culminated in the Complainant’s self-inflicted death.  The officers had lawful grounds to search for the Complainant and seek his arrest, and they were professional and prudent with due regard for public safety in the execution of a reasonable plan toward that end.  In the final analysis, though they were unable to thwart the Complainant’s fateful final act, their failure to do so was not through any want of care on their part.  In the result, there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges against theSOor any of the officers who participated in the operation, and the file is closed.Date:	November 25, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=598

,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Grey,Ontario,Both Complainant 2 and Complainant 1 were taken to hospital the former sustained debilitating injuries the latter a fractured leg,"The offences that arise for consideration on this record arecriminal negligence causing bodily harmanddangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to sections 221 and 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code, respectively.  As offences of penal negligence, liability under both sections is predicated, in part, on conduct that deviates markedly from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  While there are aspects of theSO’s conduct that are apt for legitimate criticism, I am not persuaded on reasonable grounds that the manner in which he drove was so substandard as to attract criminal liability.  It was dark at the time, visibility was not ideal and the roadway was wet.  Given the prevailing environmental conditions, it is arguable that theSOought to have travelled slower than the 60 km/h speed the data downloaded from his cruiser’sGPSunit indicated he was generally doing as he approached the point of impact.  The reduced speed would have afforded him a greater reaction time to avoid potential objects on the roadway, particularly as information broadcast over the radio had indicated the presence of persons on the street.  It is also apparent that theSO’s emergency lights and siren were not on as he travelled south on King Street toward the collision site.  Had they been, pedestrians in the area may have had greater advance warning of the cruiser approaching in their direction and taken steps to ensure their safety.On the other hand, there are a number of important extenuating circumstances that must be considered.  While theSOwas traveling in excess of the 50 km/h speed limit, he was clearly engaged in the course of his duties and therefore exempt from the speed limitation under section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act.  While the section does not confer carte blanche on police officers to speed as they wish, theSO’s speed was only moderately above the limit and certainly not such as to demonstrate a complete disregard for the safety of the public.  Further mitigating theSO’s liability were the serious nature of the incident to which he was responding, involving a report of gunshots in the area and the need for a police response that was sooner rather than later, and the unusual position of Complainant #1 and Complainant #2 on the roadway, one lying down and the other bent over him trying to pull him to safety.  With respect to the latter, it is reasonable to infer that theSOmay well have moderated his driving had he been specifically advised that there was a person lying flat on the roadway.  As it was, it appears that only general information was broadcast over the police radio relating to persons on the street.  Weighed in the balance, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that these factors are such as to render theSO’s arguably careless driving something less than a marked departure from what one would expect of a reasonable person in the circumstances.It remains a mystery as to why theSOdid not see Complainant #1 and Complainant #2 and take action to avoid striking them.  Other southbound motorists had in fact seen Complainant #2 lying on the roadway and were able to safely maneuver around him.  Perhaps the officer was distracted or momentarily incapacitated at the time for one reason or another.  Be that as it may, on the basis of what is known from theSIUinvestigation, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officer committed a criminal offence notwithstanding the serious injuries he caused.

,Greater Sudbury Police Service,Greater Sudbury,Ontario,n r\n The following story emerges from the weight of the evidence collected by the SIU On April 10 2019 the OPP contacted the GSPS to seek their assistance They were tracking a white pickup truck heading north toward the Sudbury area Its occupants the Complainant and his passenger CW 1 were wanted in connection with a recent armed robbery and firearms offences The GSPS were cautioned that the Complainant was suspected of having a shotgun in his possession and was known to have fled from attempted police stops in the past striking police vehicles in the process The GSPS tactical team was mobilized and met at the police station to discuss the situation and plan their intervention Officers in unmarked tactical trucks would deploy ahead of the suspects’ path of travel and intercede to take them into custody after they had come to a stop At about 10:45 p.m the tactical team received word from the OPP whose officers were still tailing the Complainant and CW 1 that they were traveling north on Long Lake Road in Sudbury toward the Four Corners intersection The tactical officers convened in the area WO 4 WO 12 and WO 13 were together in a tactical truck and WO 1 WO 2 and the SO in another They followed the pickup truck as it turned into Plaza 69 on the northwest corner of the intersection before exiting to cross Regent Street into the Esso gas station As the pickup truck parked with its front pointed toward a propane gas tank display cabinet against the wall of the gas station shop the decision was made to box it in with the use of the tactical vehicles Arriving first on scene some 30 seconds after the pickup truck came to a stop WO 12 drove to within a metre of the vehicle’s rear Seconds later trucks driven by WO 1 and WO 11 came to a stop with their front ends adjacent to the pickup on its passenger and driver sides respectively The officers exited their vehicles with guns drawn surrounded the pickup truck and ordered its occupants to show their hands Realizing that he had been cornered by the police the Complainant started his engine and accelerated rearward directly into the front of WO 12’s vehicle The force of the impact sent the tactical vehicle backward a short distance The Complainant continued to accelerate backward against the tactical truck spinning his wheels but failed to create any further space between the vehicles Some 15 seconds after the initial collision the Complainant accelerated forward and crashed into the propane gas tank display Immediately thereafter an SUV with the OPP officers who had followed the suspects into Sudbury and onto the gas station used its front end to push the rear passenger side of the pickup truck about a metre or more Seconds after that the SO opened the driver’s door whereupon the Complainant emerged from the pickup truck and went to the ground The Complainant was subsequently handcuffed by WO 12 and taken to hospital having sustained bullet wounds to his left arm and leg CW 1 was also removed from the pickup truck and arrested The SO was the only officer who discharged his firearm – a C8 rifle The weight of the evidence including a count of the rounds contained in his firearm after the shooting 25 information about the customary number of rounds loaded by tactical team officers in their C8 rifles 28 and the number of spent cartridge cases found at the scene 3 indicates that the SO fired his weapon three times While the evidence regarding the officer’s position at the time the shots were fired is imprecise it suggests the SO was standing in front of the pickup truck when he first fired and had travelled to the driver side of the vehicle near the driver’s door when the second two rounds were let off in quick succession n,"Whether considered pursuant to section 25(3) of theCriminal Code, setting out the limits of permissible force used by police officers that is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, or section 34, prescribing the boundaries of justifiable force in the defence of oneself or another from an actual or threatened attack, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOacted lawfully when he discharged his firearm and caused injury to the Complainant.  The former provides police officers with immunity from criminal liability provided the force in question was reasonably necessary in aid of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law and they acted under a reasonable apprehension that said force was necessary to meet a threat of death or grievous bodily harm to oneself or another.  The latter requires that the defensive act be reasonable with reference to the relevant circumstances, including the nature of the force or threat, whether there were other means to protect oneself or another, and whether any party to the incident used or threatened to use a weapon.As was his legal right, theSOdeclined to be interviewed by theSIUor authorize the release of his notes.  TheSIUis therefore without first-hand information regarding the officer’s state of mind at the time he fired his rifle.  That said, I accept that theSOfeared for his life when he discharged his weapon based on the circumstantial evidence and an utterance he made to a fellow officer in the wake of the incident.AGSPSofficer was among the tactical officers deployed that night.  He, together with two team members, arrived at the Esso station in their vehicle moments after the shooting had occurred.  In an exchange with theSO, says theGSPSofficer, the officer told him he was scared he was going to be run over by the pickup truck and believed he had to stop the Complainant.  I have no reason to doubt the reliability of theGSPSofficer’s evidence.  Nor do I doubt that theSO’s statements accurately reflect how he felt at the time of the shooting.  While potentially self-serving, those statements attract a level of authenticity for their relative contemporaneity with the events in question.  Their reliability is further bolstered by the perceptions of similarly situated officers present at the time.  For example, several officers in and around the pickup truck when the shooting happened believed the Complainant represented a real and present risk to their lives and safety should he manage to free his vehicle from the police blockade.  Specifically, they feared that the Complainant would strike an officer with the pickup truck, particularly those situated on the driver side of the vehicle which was his most likely escape route.  To reiterate, theSOwas positioned on the driver side of the pickup truck in close proximity to the vehicle.The analysis turns to the reasonableness of theSO’s apprehensions and the action he took.  The officer was positioned in front of the pickup truck when he first shot at the Complainant through its windshield.  The Complainant was in the process of accelerating rearward into the tactical truck behind him at the time.  That action would have given the officers the impression, and did in fact so impress the witness officers who spoke with theSIU, that the Complainant was bent on escaping police custody by ramming his truck free of the police vehicles.  While one might question the wisdom of taking up such a vulnerable position, the fact remains that theSOwas completely exposed to an immediate and potentially lethal risk in the event the Complainant decided to accelerate forward. The shot did not incapacitate the Complainant and, as it turns out, he did in fact travel forward mere seconds after theSO’s initial discharge, smashing into the propane gas tank display cabinet with significant force.  Fortunately, theSOhad re-positioned himself beside the driver side of the truck by that point.  In the circumstances, I have no difficulty in concluding that theSO’s beliefs and corresponding action in relation to the first discharge were reasonable.More difficult is the question of reasonableness in connection with the second two shots discharged by theSO.  These were fired at close range into the driver’s seat compartment of the pickup truck some 16 seconds after the first shot.  At that time, theSOwas not in front of the pickup truck; he was standing along the driver side within a metre or so of the driver’s door.  Arguably, he was no longer in any imminent peril by the movement of the truck.  In the circumstances, was a resort to lethal force and theSO’s belief in its necessity reasonable?  I believe they were.The law countenances an officer’s mistaken belief in the necessity of force of one kind or another so long as the belief was reasonably held.  That is, might a reasonable person in the officer’s shoes have been similarly mistaken?  Moreover, the law does not require that officers caught up in volatile and dangerous situations measure their responsive force with precision; what is required is a reasonable response, not an exacting one:R. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 SCR 206;R. v. Baxter(1975), 27 CCC (2d) 96 (Ont. CA).  Consider theSO’s situation.  He would have been briefed that the Complainant was considered armed and dangerous.  He was wanted for armed robbery, suspected of having a shotgun in his possession and known for forcing police vehicles out of the way during attempted stops.  As theSOleft his tactical truck and moved toward the pickup truck, it would have become immediately clear that the Complainant had no intention of surrendering peacefully.  He had rammed the police vehicle behind him around the time theSOinitially discharged his weapon and continued to operate the pickup truck following the first shot despite armed police officers ordering him to stop at gunpoint.  In fact, it appears the pickup was accelerating forward when theSOlet off two additional rounds in quick succession into the driver’s door window just before it smashed into the propane gas tank display.Was retreat an option?  Perhaps, but I am unable to find fault with theSO’s decision to not give way as the Complainant attempted to maneuver out of the police barricade.  The Complainant had in recent days engaged in a course of violent and reckless behaviour that threatened the lives and safety of the public around him.  His conduct on the day in question when faced with an overwhelming show of force by the police was no different.  Indeed, I am persuaded that the Complainant would not have willingly desisted but for theSO’s intervention.  I am further persuaded that the Complainant would have remained a grave risk to public safety had he managed to escape.  On this record, the officers, including theSO, were within their rights in seeking to effect the Complainant’s arrest as soon as possible and to stand their ground in doing so.There is also the matter of the sawed-off shotgun that was recovered from the pickup truck following the shooting.  To be clear, there is no indication in the evidence that the Complainant ever wielded the firearm during the incident.  None of the police witnesses questioned by theSIUmentioned seeing a gun in the Complainant’s possession and theSOsaid nothing of a firearm when explaining to aGSPSofficer why he did what he did.  Nevertheless, most if not all of the witness officers who were present at the time alluded to the likely presence of a shotgun in the pickup truck in describing the danger they were facing.  The shotgun’s presence in the pickup truck gives credence to the officers’ concerns.  I am satisfied that the same concerns would have weighed on theSO’s mind to some degree as he approached the truck.While it may be in the cold light of hindsight that theSO’s life was not in any immediate danger when he fired his second and third rounds, the officer’s belief to the contrary and his corresponding firearm discharges were in my view reasonable nonetheless.  On the aforementioned record, confronted with a violent and armed individual determined to escape police apprehension and seemingly without any qualms about using his pickup truck to effect his purpose, theSOhad good cause in the heat of the moment to believe that the truck’s continued operation represented a threat to life and limb necessitating the use of lethal force to disable its driver.For the foregoing reasons, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the shooting was anything other than lawful force in aid of the Complainant’s arrest pursuant to section 25(3) and/or section 34 of theCriminal Code.  Consequently, there is no basis to proceed with charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	March 30, 2020Electronically approved byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=676

,Toronto Police Service,St. Joseph,Ontario,n r\n The material events in question leading to the moments prior to the shooting are not in dispute Early in the morning on April 7 2019 the TPS WCGVSU led by WO 10 secured a warrant to search a condominium in the building at 235 Sherway Gardens Road They had reason to believe that the Complainant the suspect in a shooting that occurred outside a middle school on April 4 2019 was present in the unit and armed with a firearm The warrant authorized the police to search the residence and seize firearms and ammunition in connection with the shooting.\xa0 r\n\xa0 Given the possible presence of firearms in the residence WO 10 made arrangements to have Team 1 of the ETF secure the residence ahead of his team’s entry to execute the warrant WO 1 was in charge of the ETF team The team met with WO 10 outside the target building and were briefed on the situation It was decided that the ETF would conduct a “dynamic entry” in the residence a tactic whereby officers seek to neutralize potential threats via the element of surprise by rushing into a scene following the deployment of a distraction device About 6:30 a.m WO 1 and his team of ETF officers used a ram to force open the door of the unit A distraction device was then deployed in the residence just before the officers announcing their presence and search warrant authority entered The SO was among the officers that gained entry The officer armed with an MP5 rifle made his way to a bedroom at the southeast corner of the unit where the Complainant had been sleeping Joined by WO 5 the SO entered the bedroom and engaged physically with the Complainant shortly before his rifle discharged Following the shooting paramedics attended the unit loaded the Complainant onto a stretcher and took him to hospital The unit was searched for weapons with negative results n,"The immediate circumstances surrounding the firearm discharge are less than clear.  There is some evidence the Complainant rolled out of bed upon hearing the distraction device, knelt on the floor with his hands up and was confronted by an officer.  The officer kneed him in the back causing him to fall forward.  This evidence further indicates the Complainant was handcuffed and prone on the floor when a second officer shot him as he was searching a nearby closet.  There was, in fact, a second officer who was present at the time of the shooting –WO#5.WO#5 acknowledges that he was in the process of searching the bedroom closet when he heard a muffled pop.  Turning to ask what had happened, he was told by theSOthat he had not fired and then, shortly after, in an implicit admission that he had in fact discharged his weapon, that “it [the MP5 rifle] must’ve got snagged or caught on something.”  According toWO#5, theSOand the Complainant were engaged in a struggle of sorts at the time of the shooting.  As was his legal right, theSOdeclined to provide his account via an interview with theSIUor the provision of his notes.At the outset of the liability analysis, I should say that I have no reasonable grounds to believe that the shooting was an intentional act on the part of theSO.  Though the officer did not provide theSIUa statement, his utterances toWO#5 in the immediate wake of the shooting, whose recollection I have no reason to doubt, clearly suggest theSOhad not intended to discharge his firearm.  Moreover, the remainder of the evidence is not inconsistent with the notion of an accidental discharge.  There is no evidence that the officer acted deliberately when the Complainant, while prone on the bedroom floor, was shot through the right forearm.  While one cannot completely discount the possibility of an intentional shooting, the spontaneity and contemporaneity of theSO’s remarks lead me to believe the shooting was inadvertent.  That being the case, the issue turns to whether theSOis criminally responsible for the Complainant’s wound on some theory of penal negligence.The offence that arises for consideration iscareless use of a firearmcontrary to section 86 of theCriminal Code.  As a criminal offence, mere negligence will not suffice to ground liability.  What is required is conduct that amounts to something more than a simple departure from the level of care that a reasonably prudent person would have observed in the circumstances, namely, a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care:R v Gosset, [1993] 3 SCR 76. At one level, the fact that theSO’s firearm was discharged unintentionally suggests some level of carelessness on the officer’s part.  Needless to say, the MP5 rifle was a dangerous weapon and the officer was obliged to ensure he maintained proper care and control of the firearm so as to avoid accidental discharge and the prospect of needless injury or even death.The evidence of potential neglect on the part of theSO, however, must be assessed in light of what else is known and not known about the officer’s encounter with the Complainant.  Thus, for example, the weight of the evidence indicates the two were struggling on the bedroom floor as the shot went off or just prior to the discharge.WO#5, who was present in the room at the time, described theSOas being involved in a “commotion” with the Complainant that took the two from a location near the bed toward a closet at the other end of the room.  While there is some evidence the Complainant did not resist his arrest, the reliability of this evidence is open to challenge given this evidence was clearly in error in other respects. For example, this evidence also indicatesWO#5 was the shooter, not theSO, and suggests that the Complainant was handcuffed when he was shot. However, the weight of the evidence establishes the Complainant was restrained following the shooting by a third officer who entered the bedroom.The officers also had reason to believe that the Complainant was in possession of a firearm as they entered the residence, a firearm which he had allegedly used in the commission of a shooting offence outside a school several days earlier.  The search warrant they had secured for the residence and the briefing that they had received prior to storming the unit made that clear.It is also apparent that theETFofficers had moved away in recent years from using “Y-slings” to harness their weapons, which had proved problematic in at least one prior incident involving the discharge of anETFofficer’s rifle.As for what remains a mystery, it is unknown whether theSOhad his finger on or off his MP5 rifle’s trigger during his encounter with the Complainant.  While much is left in the discretion of individualETFofficers based on their level of skill and experience, it would appear recognized best practice to keep one’s finger off the trigger in order to avoid accidental discharges until such time as the officer has decided to fire the weapon.It is most unfortunate that the Complainant was unintentionally shot and wounded.  Conversely, it is most fortunate that his wound was not any more serious than it was or even lethal.  TheSOcarried the firearm – an MP5 rifle – which discharged and resulted in the injury to the Complainant’s right forearm.  He was duty bound to handle his firearm safely so that it did not fire accidentally.  Arguably, the officer fell short in that duty.  The issue for determination, however, is whether there is evidence to reasonably establish a sufficient want of care on theSO’s part warranting criminal sanction.  In my view, given the extenuating circumstances that prevailed at the time, there is not.TheSOwas in the lawful execution of his duty when, pursuant to a search warrant, he and otherETFofficers entered the unit.  In particular, given everything he knew of the Complainant and his reported participation in a shooting days’ prior, theSOwas within his rights in taking the Complainant into custody.  He was also well-advised to suspect the Complainant might have ready access to a firearm; that concern was, after all, the reason why theETFhad been called out to assist in the first place.  Consequently, one understands why theSOmight have had his MP5 rifle at the ready as he confronted the Complainant and then engaged with him on the bedroom floor.  Moreover, it seems clear that theSOand the Complainant were engaged in a struggle on the floor around the time of the MP5 discharge.One strongly suspects that the struggle is somehow at the root of the gun being fired.  Perhaps the trigger snagged on the officer’s equipment-laden vest and went off; this wasWO#5’s impression when he asked theSOwhat had happened.  Maybe the officer depressed the trigger unwittingly or reflexively while distracted by the physical confrontation in which he was engaged.In any event, given the constellation of factors at play – the Complainant’s lawful arrest, the possibility of an illicit firearm, a struggle of some nature and extent - I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSO’s firearm discharged inadvertently because of a marked lack of care on the part of the officer.  The analysis might have been different were there some indication that theSOhad his finger on the trigger as he tussled with the Complainant but, to reiterate, there is no positive evidence of that and some evidence to contrary effect. In the result, I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that the care exercised by theSOover his firearm, or lack thereof, transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminallaw.  There is therefore no basis to proceed with criminal charges against the officer and the file is closed.Date:	February 5, 2020Original signed byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=636

,Ontario Provincial Police,Sault Ste. Marie,Ontario,The officer sustained minor injuries in the collision apparently the result of his cruiser’s airbag deployment,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, liability under the section rests on conduct that, in addition to being objectively characterized as dangerous, amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances:R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49;R. v. Sharp(1984), 12 CCC (3d) 428 (Ont. C.A.).  While I have no doubt that theSOwas driving dangerously in the moments before the collision, and that his dangerous driving was largely responsible for what occurred, I am of the view that the evidence falls just short of justifying criminal charges against the officer.The central issue in the liability analysis is with theSO’s speed.  While traveling west on Highway 101 some six kilometres from the scene of the collision, there was a pronounced increase in the officer’s velocity to about 136 km/h from 111 km/h eight seconds earlier, presumably in response to the theft call in Wawa.  TheSOcontinued apace westward at speeds between 121 km/h and 152 km/h over the course of the next five and a half kilometres, traveling for the most part at 140 km/h and above against a 90 km/h speed limit.  Some 450 metres east of the collision site, there was a traffic sign for westbound motorists indicating a drop in the speed limit from 90 km/h to 50 km/h as the highway wound its way into the Town of Wawa.  TheSOappears to have entered this zone at about 138 km/h, thereafter decelerating to 113 km/h within a span of 250 metres. At the point of impact, a further 150 metres down the road, theSOwas travelling at about 71 km/h.I am satisfied that theSO’s speeds as he responded to the theft call, which were significantly in excess of the speed limits that governed the roadway over which he travelled, constituted a risk to traffic around him.  I am further satisfied that the officer’s speed was the pivotal factor in the collision that occurred.  The Complainant appears to have done little if anything wrong in relation to the accident, and I do not believe he saw theSO’s cruiser before entering the roadway.  Travelling as fast as it was, it is conceivable that the cruiser would not have been visible to the Complainant until just before impact.  On the other hand, theSOappears to have seen the Complainant’s snowmobile entering onto the roadway but was unable to avoid a collision owing, in my view, to the speed at which he was travelling.Further aggravating the danger caused by theSO’s speed was the officer’s failure to activate his emergency lights and/or siren.  He ought to have known, particularly as he crossed into the 50 km/h zone, that traffic around him would have little time to react to his cruiser given how fast it was going.  In the circumstances, the officer ought to have activated his emergency lights and/or siren to alert the public as early as possible to his presence.  One is left to speculate, reasonably in my view, that the Complainant might well have not ventured onto the roadway when he did had he been given advance notice of the cruiser via its siren or emergency lights.Finally, when considering the inculpatory impact of theSO’s speed, it is important to bear in mind that a police officer’s foremost duty is at all times the preservation of life.  It does a police officer no good if in responding to a call for service his or her conduct unduly endangers public safety.  I fully appreciate that police officers are frequently faced with difficult choices with little time in which to make them, and that allowance must be made for less than exacting decisions made in the heat of the moment.  That said, in the context of an officer who had travelled several kilometres over approximately three minutes before the collision occurred, it is difficult to countenance the persistence of theSO’s excessive speed to get to the scene of what was, after all, a property offence.On the other side of the ledger, while one might question the wisdom of traveling as fast as theSOwas to get to the scene of a reported theft, the fact remains that he was engaged in the execution of his duty and therefore exempt from the speed limits pursuant to section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act.  This is not to suggest that theSOhad carte-blanche to speed as he wished without regard to public safety; however, quite apart from whether theSOpaid sufficient heed to public safety as he sped westward on Highway 101, it is important to recognize that he was a police officer responding to the scene of a reported crime.   In other words, if the officer’s conduct was ill-guided, it was not without rhyme or reason.It is also true that most of Highway 101 over which theSOtravelled in response to the reported theft was predominantly rural in nature with little development on either side of the road.  It was only as theSOapproached the Town of Wawa and the speed limit became 50 km/h for westbound traffic, some 450 metres from the collision scene, that the officer’s speed coalesced with the environment around him to create a clear and present danger of accident.  In the circumstances, while I am unable to characterize the gravamen of theSO’s transgressions as fleeting or momentary, it was relatively short-lived – about half a kilometre and some 13 seconds.The evidence further suggests that snowbanks on the shoulder of the highway, trees and shrubs on both sides of the snowmobile trail, and a “no parking” sign just east of the location where the Complainant attempted to cross the roadway may have obstructed his line of sight toward the approaching cruiser, thereby contributing to the accident.  In fact, the obstructions may well have detracted from theSO’s sightlines as well.  All of which is to suggest that the officer’s speed was likely not the only factor at play in the collision.Lastly, it would not appear that the environmental conditions that prevailed at the time exacerbated the risks to public safety inherent in theSO’s speed.  The roadway was dry and in fair condition, and visibility was good.In the final analysis, while one may legitimately criticize theSOfor the manner in which he operated his police cruiser in the moments leading to its collision with the Complainant and his snowmobile, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officer’s conduct was so substandard as to amount to a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care.  Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case and the file is therefore closed.Date:	February 5, 2020Original signed byJoseph MartinoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=634
,Ontario Provincial Police,Simcoe,Ontario,n r\n The weight of the reliable evidence gathered by the SIU gives rise to the following scenario On April 2 2019 at about 8:45 a.m the Complainant arrived at the OPP Norfolk County Detachment further to arrangements made the previous day with SO 2 who together with SO 1 was investigating the Complainant for historic offences The Complainant was escorted into the boardroom where he was advised by the officers that he was under arrest The Complainant did not take well to the news He questioned the charges became belligerent and physically resisted the officers as they attempted to take him into custody SO 1 and SO 2 reacted by pinning the Complainant against a wall and then taking him to the floor facedown While on the ground the Complainant flailed his legs and refused to release his arms from underneath his torso to be handcuffed The officers grappled with the Complainant with little success At one point SO 2 observed the Complainant with a knife in his left hand and alerted SO 1 the Complainant had carried the knife to the meeting in a pants pocket At news of the weapon SO 1 delivered three knee strikes to the Complainant’s right torso whereupon SO 2 was able to pry the knife out of the Complainant’s left hand Additional officers began to arrive in the boardroom as the struggle with the Complainant continued on the floor SO 3 among them With the assistance of WO 4 who pulled up the Complainant’s coat to expose his back SO 3 deployed his CEW the probes struck the Complainant’s backside above the waist Shortly thereafter the Complainant’s hands were cuffed behind his back Following his arrest the Complainant was searched and then lodged in a cell Some time later the Complainant complained of pain and arrangements were made to have him taken to hospital n,"It should be noted that there is some evidence suggesting a version of events that involves a far more severe application of police force.  This evidence provides that the Complainant was repeatedly kicked by various officers while on the floor and offering no resistance.  Moreover, this evidence further indicates that one of the officers discharged aCEWat the Complainant after he was handcuffed, that the Complainant was thrown down a flight of stairs and that the Complainant was assaulted by another officer in a room where he was taken to contact his lawyer.If true, this version of what occurred would necessarily lead one to believe the Complainant was the victim of an unlawful assault at the hands of multiple officers.  However, I am satisfied that it would be unwise and unsafe to rest criminal charges on the strength of this evidence alone.  Not only does this evidence stand in stark contrast to the overriding weight of the testimonial evidence, it is belied by video recordings captured by cameras in the cell block area, which establish that no officer entered the room in which the Complainant had been taken to speak with a lawyer.  In the circumstances, the evidence of excessive force is, in my view, insufficiently trustworthy to warrant being put to the test by a trier-of-fact in the absence of corroboration.  While the Complainant’s injuries might in another case have provided that corroboration, they are incapable of doing so in this one as they are equally consistent with the nature and extent of the police force that emerges on the weight of the remaining evidence.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.  I am unable to conclude on the totality of the evidence gathered by theSIUthatSO#1 andSO#2 had insufficient grounds to take the Complainant into custody based on their investigation of the historic offences.  When the Complainant physically resisted his arrest, the officers were entitled to resort to a measure of force to effect their purpose.  The question is whether they crossed the line into excessive force in so doing.  In my view, they did not.SO#1 took the lead in dealing with the Complainant, first by pinning him against a wall and then grounding him to the floor.  I am unable to find fault in the officer’s choice of tactics in this regard.  The Complainant had made it clear that he would not be arrested without a struggle of some sort.  He had also refusedSO#1’s direction that he remove his left hand from inside his left front pants pocket, causing the officer concern about a possible weapon in his possession.  In the circumstances,SO#1 was entitled to force him against the wall and then to the ground, from which position the officers could better control the Complainant’s movements.The Complainant continued to resist while on the ground and gave the officers further cause for concern when it became obvious he was in possession of a knife.SO#1 delivered three knee strikes to the Complainant’s torso attempting to free the Complainant’s arms from underneath his prostrate body.  This was followed by a singleCEWdischarge of five seconds’ duration.  Following theCEWdischarge, the Complainant’s hands were finally secured and handcuffed.  Confronted with a physically recalcitrant individual, armed for a period with a knife and refusing to surrender his hands, the knee strikes andCEWdeployment do not seem to me to be a disproportionate or excessive use of force.  In arriving at this conclusion, it is important to bear in mind that the law does not require that police officers involved in dynamic and dangerous situations measure their responsive force to a nicety; what is required is a reasonable response, not an exacting one:R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 SCR 206;R. v. Baxter(1975), 27 CCC (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.).In the result, while I accept that the Complainant’s injuries likely occurred during the altercation that marked his arrest, presumably when he was pinned against the wall, taken to the floor or struck bySO#1’s knee, I am satisfied that the force used by the officers waslegally justified.  Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	November 4, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=586

,Ontario Provincial Police,Hamilton,Ontario,n r\n The events in question are clear on the evidence collected by the SIU in its investigation which included statements from the SO Complainant 1 and Complainant 2 GPS data associated with the SO’s vehicle and information derived from the SIU’s forensic examination of the scene and police communications recordings In the early morning hours of March 16 2019 the SO was stationary in her marked police cruiser on the southside shoulder of the QEW in the area of Seventh Street Louth She was conducting radar enforcement of traffic traveling eastbound on the highway Shortly before 3:00 a.m Complainant 1’s BMW drove past the SO’s location and was clocked doing 134 km/h The SO decided to stop Complainant 1’s vehicle for speeding The SO pulled onto the highway and accelerated eastbound in an effort to catch up to the BMW reaching a top speed of 174 km/h in the process Complainant 1 took the next off-ramp to exit onto Highway 406 followed at a distance by the SO The officer followed Complainant 1 onto the ramp activating her emergency lights about this time Complainant 1 changed lanes leading the SO to believe he was pulling over He was not Rather Complainant 1 picked up speed and increased the distance between the vehicles as he headed south on Highway 406 The SO eventually lost sight of the BMW’s taillights whereupon she contacted the communications centre to report that a car clocked at 134 km/h had failed to stop The SO turned off her emergency lights and continued along Highway 406 The SO had travelled as far as Glendale Avenue when she received word over her radio of a single motor vehicle collision at Fourth Avenue and Highway 406 The officer doubled-back to the location of the collision and upon arrival observed Complainant 1’s vehicle crashed against a retaining wall on the south side of Fourth Avenue across from the off-ramp from Highway 406 Complainant 1 had entered onto the Fourth Avenue off-ramp from the highway at a speed over 220 km/h and lost control of his BMW The vehicle careened over the traffic island lining the off-ramp and struck the centre median on Fourth Avenue whereupon it went airborne before striking the concrete retaining wall Arriving firefighters and paramedics assisted in extricating Complainant 1 and Complainant 2 from the demolished vehicle and they were taken to hospital.\n,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As an offence of penal negligence, the crime is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances: R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49.  The evidence, in my view, falls well short of suggesting theSObreached the standard of care in the way she engaged with Complainant #1 prior to the collision.  TheSOwas within her rights in seeking to stop Complainant #1 for a speeding infraction; she had clocked him travelling more than 30 km/h over the speed limit on Highway 406.  Moreover, the officer was never very close to Complainant #1.  Though theSOaccelerated to more than 170 km/h, Complainant #1 matched and exceeded her speed, lengthening the distance between their vehicles.  As soon as theSOlost sight of the BMW, she promptly de-activated her emergency lights and reported what had just occurred over the radio.  By the time Complainant #1 attempted to exit the highway onto Fourth Avenue at more than 200 km/h, crashing his vehicle in the process, theSOwas nowhere in the vicinity.  In fact, the officer drove past the collision site some time later not realizing what had happened.  In the circumstances, it certainly cannot be said that the officer unduly pushed Complainant #1 or otherwise prevented him from slowing down or coming to a safe stop had he been inclined.Of some concern is theSO’s speeds on Highway 406, topping out at 174 km/h.  The officer’s speed, however, must be understood in context.  As theSOstarted from a stopped position when the BMW sped past her, one can appreciate the need for the officer to accelerate well past the speed limit to catch up with Complainant #1.  Thereafter, theSO’s speeds never exceeded 155 km/h as she chased the BMW and were for the most part in the neighbourhood of 130 km/h before the officer turned off her emergency lights, disengaged and slowed further.   It is also important to note that the environmental conditions at the time did not exacerbate the risks inherent in the speed at which theSOwas traveling: there was little traffic on the roadway, the roads were dry, and visibility was good.  On this record, I am satisfied that theSO, though exempt from the speed limit under section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act, did not speed at the expense of public safety.In the final analysis, in the context of a very brief engagement transpiring over approximately four kilometres and a couple of minutes, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOexercised a level of care within the limits prescribed by the criminal law.

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,Following his arrest the Complainant was taken to hospital where his injuries were diagnosed and treated,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force is reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they are required or authorized to do by law.  Based on the information at their disposal from the 911 call and their own observations of the Complainant at the scene, it is evident that the Complainant was subject to lawful arrest for his assaultive and threatening behaviour with a knife.I am further satisfied that theSOwas legally justified in shooting the Complainant.  The Complainant was armed with a dangerous weapon capable of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death.  He had also demonstrated a propensity to use it prior to the officers’ arrival.  TheSOandWO#1 confronted the Complainant and gave him an opportunity to surrender peacefully.  To no avail, they ordered him to drop the knife.  Disengagement was not an option as there were people still in the store whose safety would be placed at risk were the officers to exit the premises.  TheSOdid, however, retreat to the extent he could as the Complainant advanced quickly on him while discharging his shotgun four times at the Complainant.  TheSOdid so, as he explained, fearing for his own life as well as his partner’s.  His apprehension, in my view, was reasonable in the circumstances given the distance between him and the Complainant, the knife in the Complainant’s right hand, the confined space in which the incident unfolded, and the Complainant’s determination as he closed in on theSO.  While none of the discharges felled the Complainant or were successful in directly disarming him, they did stall the Complainant’s forward progress and get his attention.  Moments later, the Complainant tossed away the knife and took to the floor at the officers’ requests.In conclusion, I am unable to reasonably conclude on the foregoing record that the force used by theSOtransgressed the limits prescribed by the criminal law.  Confronted with a real and imminent risk to life and limb, the officer, in my view, reasonably believed that shooting the Complainant was necessary to meet that risk and effect the Complainant’s arrest.  Consequently, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges against theSOand the file is closed.Date:	November 4, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=566

,York Regional Police,York,Ontario,n r\n The material facts in issue are apparent on the information gathered in the SIU’s investigation The weather was clear traffic was light to moderate and the roads were dry and in good repair The SO on duty and traveling west on Highway 407 observed a Honda Odyssey van speeding ahead of him The Complainant the driver of the van was on his way to work The officer accelerated to about 160 km/h in an effort to keep pace with the van Just west of the Jane Street overpass the Complainant began to slow down as the SO activated his emergency lights and siren Both vehicles maneuvered to the north shoulder of the highway where they came to a stop the van in front of the police vehicle The SO exited his SUV approached the passenger side of the van and advised the Complainant that he would be charged with stunt driving and speeding under the Highway Traffic Act HTA A tow truck arrived at the scene positioned itself in front of the Complainant’s van on the shoulder and began to hook up the Honda Odyssey The Complainant was escorted to the police vehicle and took a seat in the back passenger side as the officer prepared his tickets The officer offered to call the Complainant a taxi but he opted to wait until the officer was ready to drive him to a location off the highway Shortly thereafter the SO decided to position his vehicle on the live lane of traffic beside the tow truck and the Honda van He did so to provide a safety buffer to the tow truck operator as he continued with his work Within minutes a GMC Denali SUV operated by CW 1 traveling west in the northern most lane of the highway slammed head on with the rear of the police vehicle propelling it west toward the shoulder where it came to rest The Complainant was seriously injured resulting in a complete loss of sensation from the chest down r\n\r\n,"The offences that arise for consideration on this record are dangerous driving causing bodily harm and criminal negligence causing bodily harm contrary to sections 320.13(2) and 221 of theCriminal Code, respectively.  Both offences are predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  I accept that theSOwas acting with the safety of the tow truck operator in mind when he moved his vehicle off the highway shoulder onto a live lane of traffic.  The question is whether, in so doing, he placed the Complainant in peril in a dangerous or criminally negligent manner within the terms of the criminal law.  In my view, there are no reasonable grounds to so believe.  No doubt, theSO’s decision placed his cruiser at greater risk of a collision with motorists traveling past the scene at the side of the highway.  On the other hand, theSOhad his full emergency lighting activated at all times and could reasonably expect that his cruiser would be noticed well in advance by motorists traveling toward his vehicle.  Indeed, it is clear that motorists in the vicinity were alerted to theSO’s location in good time and took steps to change lanes safely.  Under the terms of theHTA,CW#1 was legally obligated to do so as well, but for some reason appears not to have noticed the policeSUVin the lane in front of him until he smashed into it.  On this record, I am satisfied on balance that theSOconducted himself within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law. Accordingly, there are no reasonable grounds for concluding that theSOcaused or contributed to the Complainant’s injuries in a manner giving rise to criminal liability, and the file is closed.Date:	June 25, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=365
,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,n r\n The following description of the circumstances surrounding the Complainant’s arrest is as far as it goes largely uncontested in the evidence gathered by the SIU The Complainant and his associate were occupants in a BMW vehicle being followed by undercover YRP officers They were the targets of an ongoing police investigation for property crimes While under surveillance they were observed entering a darkened home in Vaughan and then exiting with property in their possession When the undercover team confirmed that the back door into the home had been smashed upon the decision was made to arrest the Complainant and his associate for break and enter Additional undercover officers in unmarked vehicles were enlisted to track the movements of the BMW and assist in the pending arrests of its occupants At about 8:00 p.m on January 5 2019 as the BMW entered onto the driveway in front of the apartment building on Bathurst Street Toronto and stopped adjacent to the entrance to the building one of the undercover officers called for the BMW’s “takedown” WO 5 positioned his vehicle nose-to-nose in front of the BMW as SO 1 stopped his vehicle directly behind it WO 10 maneuvered her vehicle’s front end toward the BMW’s front driver door preventing it from opening The officers exited their vehicles and rushed toward the BMW some with firearms drawn They ordered the Complainant and his passenger to show their hands and exit their BMW It is here in the story that the evidence gives rise to competing accounts of what happened next The more incriminating account suggests that the Complainant raised his hands and tried to exit the BMW but was unable to because the driver’s door was pinned shut by one of the police vehicles At this point an officer reached through his half-open driver’s door window and punched the left side of the Complainant’s face three or four times The driver’s side door was eventually opened and the Complainant pulled out of the vehicle onto the ground This evidence further alleges that the Complainant was handcuffed quickly on the ground and then made to suffer multiple punches and knee strikes to various parts of his body including one particularly forceful punch to the head that temporarily knocked the Complainant unconscious It is further alleged that an officer used his foot to press the Complainant’s head into the pavement three or four times The scenario that emerges on the accounts of the police officers interviewed by the SIU stands in marked contrast to the evidence described above Far from raising his hands and surrendering peacefully to police when surrounded the Complainant is said to have immediately placed his BMW in reverse and squealed his tires in an effort to break free from the blockade Unable to escape the Complainant was forcibly removed from the driver’s seat after WO 10 moved her car allowing the officers to open the BMW’s driver’s side door The Complainant landed front first and lay prone on the ground the right side of his face exposed and his arms tucked underneath him SO 1 SO 2 and SO 3 surrounded the Complainant on the ground and repeatedly ordered him to release his arms When he refused to do so and fought against the officers’ efforts to yank them free SO 2 twice punched the Complainant’s head and shoulder area attempting to secure his compliance With the same objective in mind SO 3 delivered three to four punches to the Complainant’s face and when that did not work to help liberate the Complainant’s arms punched him three or four more times in the lower back A short while later the officers were successful in wrestling control of the Complainant’s arms and securing them in handcuffs behind his back No further force was used on the Complainant n,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=535

,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,n r\n The following sequence of events as far as they go emerge from the evidence gathered by the SIU in its investigation which included a statement from the Complainant the notes of the incident prepared by the SO and video recordings captured by surveillance cameras of the Complainant’s activities just prior to his arrest At about 3:40 a.m a 911 call was placed to PRP indicating that two individuals were breaking into the Holt Renfrew store at the Square One Shopping Mall in Mississauga The Complainant was one of those individuals Together with the CW he had entered the store from Mercer Street by breaking a window The two exited the store through the same broken window and entering a nearby Porsche vehicle The SO received word of the break-in while on patrol in the area in his cruiser He made his way onto Mercer Street from City Centre Drive turned right to head north and immediately encountered the Porsche which began to travel south in his direction The officer turned his cruiser right and struck the Porsche causing it to rotate clockwise before coming to a rest at the northeast corner of the City Centre Drive and Mercer Street intersection Both the Complainant and the CW exited their vehicle and began to flee southward The SO took up the chase on foot and focused his attention on the Complainant Within moments the SO caught up with the Complainant and placed him in handcuffs The CW was also taken into custody by other officers arriving at the scene.\n,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability with respect to force used in the course of their duties provided such force was no more than was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.  Turning first to the motor vehicle collision between theSO’s cruiser and the Porsche in which the Complainant was an occupant, I am satisfied that it was caused by theSOin an effort to block the Porsche’s path so that he could investigate persons within it for the reported break-and-enter.  TheSOwas within his rights, in my view, in seeking to detain the Complainant and theCWfor investigation.  Given the location of the Porsche, beside the Holt Renfrew window where the suspects were seen to have entered and exited the store, and the vehicle’s attempt to drive past the police cruiser traveling the wrong way south on Mercer Street, theSOcould reasonably suspect that its occupants were implicated in the crime, thereby justifying their detention for investigative purposes:R v Mann, [2004] 3 SCR 59.  As for the tactic theSOadopted to stop the Porsche, while driving a cruiser into a fleeing vehicle might seem excessive, the officer had little option at the time if he was going to effect his purpose as the Porsche was in the process of maneuvering around him.  Done at relatively low speed and with no other traffic on the roadway, I am unable to reasonably conclude on this record that the officer’s conduct fell outside the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances.The liability analysis is less clear when it comes to the force used by theSOto arrest the Complainant after he exited and fled from the Porsche.  By this point in time, I am satisfied that the officer had necessary grounds to take the Complainant into custody for the break-in at the Holt Refrew store.  Not only was he in the area of the crime and fleeing from the police in a vehicle, he was now also on foot trying to get away.  In his notes, theSOsays that he caught up to the Complainant a distance from the collision as he fell into some bushes on the south side of Holt Refrew.  According to the officer, the Complainant resisted on the ground and refused to surrender his arms for handcuffing, prompting the officer to punch the Complainant four times.  No further force was used and the Complainant was handcuffed.  There is some evidence that the Complainant voluntarily gave up the chase and had gone to the ground on his front when the officer jumped on his back with both knees, breaking his ribs in the process.  The officer then allegedly punched his head and kicked his ribs before he was handcuffed.  At no point, according to this evidence, did the Complainant struggle against theSO’s efforts.I am inclined to accept that theSOmight well have placed his weight on the Complainant with his knees as the latter lay prone on the ground.  By that time, the officer would have had good cause to believe he was dealing with a potentially dangerous individual given his association with the break-and-enter and his concerted effort to escape police custody.    In the circumstances, it seems to me that placing his knees to the Complainant’s back to keep him down was a reasonable tactic to have adopted until the officer could be assured the Complainant did not pose a threat.  I also accept that the Complainant was punched a minimum of four times; theSOconcedes as much in his notes.  What I find difficult to resolve is whether the Complainant was the subject of any further force used by the officer, as a body of evidence suggests, and whether the Complainant physically resisted his arrest, as theSOclaims.  With respect to theSO’s assertions on these fronts, they must be taken with a grain of salt given they were not tested via an interview withSIUinvestigators.  The allegations against theSO, on the other hand, suffer from their own frailties.  The source of this evidence was evasive in hisSIUinterview and gave the impression that the source had things they wanted to hide as regards the events of that night.  As for the Complainant’s fractured ribs, which otherwise might have served to support the allegations, it is incapable of doing so in this case given the distinct possibility the injury happened in the motor vehicle collision or as a result of theSOcoming down with his knees and full weight onto the Complainant on the ground, both of which I am satisfied occurred as the result of force that was legally justified.In the final analysis, while I recognize that charging authorities must limit their assessments of competing evidence to threshold considerations, I find that the strength of the incriminating evidence is not sufficiently trustworthy to ground a reasonable belief that the officer used unlawful force against the Complainant in the course of restraining him inhandcuffs.  Consequently, there are no grounds to proceed with criminal charges against theSOand the file is closed.Date:	September 23, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=501
,Toronto Police Service,Grey,Ontario,Complainant 1 Complainant 2 and Complainant 3 were each diagnosed with serious injuries,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 320.13(2) of theCriminal Code.  As a crime of penal negligence, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  Of central importance to the liability analysis in this case is the fact that theSOhad the right-of-way through the intersection.  Unlike Complainant #1, the officer was not faced with any traffic signal requiring her to stop before entering the intersection.  On the other hand, southbound traffic on Woodmount Avenue was governed by a stop sign at Cosburn Avenue.  While it appears Complainant #1 stopped or at least slowed at the sign, the evidence establishes that she failed to yield to the cruiser as was her legal obligation.  It is difficult to understand why Complainant #1 drove through the intersection when she did; the police cruiser had its lights and siren activated as it travelled west on Cosburn Avenue, and was visible to other motorists from a distance, who reacted properly in pulling their vehicle over and coming to a stop.  It may be that Complainant #1 presumed the intersection was governed by stop signs in all directions and that the cruiser would stop, or perhaps, as the evidence suggests might have played a role, her vision eastward toward the cruiser as it approached was obstructed by fencing in the area of the intersection’s northeast corner.  Be that as it may, the legal onus was on her to enter the intersection only when it was safe to do so and after coming to a full stop.Turning the attention to theSO’s conduct, the only potentially objectionable conduct on her part appears to have been her speed.  The evidence indicates she was traveling upwards of 80 km/h on Cosburn Avenue west toward Woodmount Avenue, more than twice the posted 40 km/h speed limit.  It is certainly the case that theSOwould have had more time to react and might have been able to avoid a collision of the nature that occurred had she been travelling at a reduced speed.  That said, the officer was on duty responding to a call for assistance and therefore exempt from the speed limit pursuant to section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act.  Moreover, while the provision does not confer carte-blanche on officers to speed as they wish, there is no indication that the manner in which theSOwas operating the cruiser endangered the public around her prior to the collision.  Indeed, it is important to note that whatever inherent risk theSO’s speed carried with it was not exacerbated by the environmental conditions that prevailed at the time; the roads were in good condition, the weather was clear and there was little if any traffic on the road.On the aforementioned record, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSO’s driving fell well within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

I have no hesitation in concluding on the record gathered in theSIU’s investigation that theSO’s use of force was sanctioned pursuant to section 34.  Both he andWO#1 were engaged in the course of their lawful duties when they responded to a report of a home invasion and attempted to speak with the Complainant.  Though they were not certain of his identity at the time, the Complainant was in the area of the reported crime, had provided his first name (which matched that of the suspect), and was acting suspiciously in walking away from the officers and refusing to engage in conversation.  In the circumstances, given the gravity of the crime they were investigating and its ongoing nature, the officers had ample grounds in my view to investigate the Complainant and to detain him when he continued to rummage in his truck against the officers’ directions: seeR v Mann, [2004] 3 SCR 59.  Regrettably, the Complainant physically resisted his detention and then produced a pistol, which he pointed in the officers’ direction at close range.  TheSOreacted by first deploying hisCEWand then, when that proved ineffective in disabling the Complainant, discharging his firearm multiple times.  While the pistol was in fact a starter pistol and incapable of firing live rounds, theSOcould not have known that; at the time he fired hisCEWand firearm, the officer had every reason to believe the pistol was a dangerous weapon and that his life and that ofWO#1 were in imminent danger.  In fact, while theSOdeclined an interview with theSIU, his notes make clear that he thought the Complainant was about to kill him as he took a position at the front of the truck and aimed the pistol in the officer’s direction.  I believe him.  The fact thatWO#1 had also drawn his firearm and was about to shoot the Complainant at precisely the same moment as theSOfired his weapon lends further credence to the enormity of the threat confronted by theSO.  In the final analysis, faced with what he reasonably perceived to be a lethal threat with little or no opportunity for retreat or effective cover, I am persuaded that the use by theSOof hisCEWand firearm was a proportional and reasonably necessary defensive act.  Accordingly, there is no reasonable basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	June 12, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=356

,Guelph Police Service,Guelph,Ontario,The Complainant was transported to hospital where he was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and multiple fractures,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to section 249(3) of theCriminal Code.[3]Liability under the provision is predicated, in part, on conduct that deviates markedly from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  On the record as established by theSIUinvestigation, there are no reasonable grounds, in my view, to believe that theSOran afoul of the limits prescribed by the criminal law during his engagement with the Complainant.  The officer was within his rights in seeking to investigate the Complainant as his vehicle was seen in the area of a reported assault.  He activated his cruiser’s emergency lights and began to follow the Complainant but was never able to get near him as the Complainant accelerated to reach significant speeds.  It is true that theSOalso increased his speed in excess of the speed limits on Bagot Street, Willow Road and then Silvercreek Parkway North.  However, the officer was for the most part only moderately over the relevant speed limits and had licence to do so pursuant to section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act.  While officers are not entitled under that provision to speed as they wish without regard for public safety considerations, there is no evidence that theSOimperiled any motorist or pedestrian along the pursuit route.  That would include the Complainant, who was so far ahead of the officer – at the front end of a 40 second interval between the vehicles as he approached the site of the collision – that he had every opportunity to bring his vehicle to a safe stop or a safer speed had he been so inclined.  On this record, I am unable to reasonably conclude that theSOdrove dangerously in breach of the criminal law as he engaged the Complainant.  Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	September 13, 2019Joseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=489
,Toronto Police Service,Armour,Ontario,Paramedics attended the scene and took the Complainant to hospital where he was diagnosed with multiple lacerations and injuries to his face and both hands,"Whether pursuant to section 25(3) of theCriminal Code, setting the parameters for the justified use of lethal force by police officers in the lawful discharge of their duties, or section 34, which prescribes the limits for the justified use of force by anyone in defence of oneself or another from assault, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOacted lawfully when he discharged his weapon at the Complainant, inflicting serious injuries in the process.  He and the other officers were within their rights in approaching the vehicle to search it pursuant to a facially valid search warrant.  He and his colleagues,WO#2 andWO#4, were also entitled to do so at gunpoint.  They had information, sufficient to have the search warrant issued, that the Complainant was known to be in possession of an unlawful firearm.  In the circumstances, they were well-advised to have their firearms at the ready in case they were required to repel a lethal threat.  Regrettably, it was precisely such a risk that materialized.Perhaps the key question in the liability analysis regarding theSOis who fired first, the officer or the Complainant.  I am unable to place any weight on the suggestion that the Complainant was shot multiple times without any provocation on his part given the evidence that a Ruger, found in his vehicle, was in fact discharged four times from within the vehicle in the direction of the officers.  Of course, it is arguable that those shots may in themselves have been justified in self-defence if theSOacted prematurely in firing his C8 rifle, such as might be the case if it was the officer who was the first to discharge his weapon.  The weight of the evidence, however, indicates that it was in fact the Complainant who was the instigator.  InWO#4’s account of what occurred, the officer observed the Complainant with a black object in his hand or hands, followed by a muzzle flash from within the Honda which he instantly associated with a shot being fired by the Complainant.WO#2’s evidence is to similar effect; he said he saw the Complainant with a gun in his hand as he approached the front of the Honda vehicle, followed by a muzzle flash inside the car.  It was only thereafter, according toWO#2 andWO#4, that they heard a string of rapid-fire gunshots, most of which would have come from the C8 rifle being discharged by theSO.  Importantly, the officers’ evidence is generally consistent with the accounts proffered by the civilian witnesses who described hearing the exchange of gunfire.  Finally, video recordings of the incident captured by the apartment building’s surveillance cameras, which were not of great quality given it was dark outside, the distance to the takedown and the glare created by the vehicles’ headlights, did appear to capture two, and possibly more, flashes of light emanating from inside the Honda just as theSO,WO#2 andWO#4 exited their vehicle.  While these may have been caused by the involved vehicles’ headlights and/or the flashlight affixed to theSO’s C8 rifle, they are arguably also consistent with muzzle flashes from the Complainant’s handgun.  On this record, I accept that theSOdischarged his firearm in the reasonable apprehension that doing so was necessary to protect himself and his partners from death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of bullets fired first by the Complainant.  The officer was authorized to search the Complainant’s vehicle and to take steps to do so in safety.  Confronted by bullets being discharged in his direction, theSOwas entitled to meet the threat with lethal force of his own.  Fortunately for all involved, no one was killed.The question turns to whether the number of shots fired by theSOwas excessive.  If the decision to shoot was justified at the outset, as I am reasonably satisfied it was, did firing 28 shots in total cross the line?   While the number of bullets fired in the direction of the Complainant undoubtedly constituted a significant level of lethal force, they would have occurred over a span of seconds, during which time, the evidence indicates, the Complainant fired at least one additional shot beyond his initial volley.  Moreover, though the Complainant was injured as the result of the officer’s gunfire, the fact he was able to reverse his vehicle and then exit from it after it was over indicates he was not incapacitated by theSO’s discharges; that is to say, he remained a legitimate danger as long as he had access to the firearm.  In light of these considerations, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the threat faced by theSOthroughout the exchange of gunfire materially differed from his first shot to the last so as to call into question the necessity of his final rounds.  To do otherwise, in my view, would be to fail to recognize that the law does not impose a standard of perfection on officers who find themselves involved in violent and dynamic circumstances; what is required in the heat of the moment is a reasonable response, not an exacting one:R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010]1 SCR 206;R. v. Baxter(1975), 27 CCC (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.).In the final analysis, confronted by an individual armed with a gun and firing it in his direction, theSOwas legally justified under section 25(3) and 34 of theCriminal Codein firing back in the reasonable belief that doing so was necessary to protect himself and his colleagues from a lethal threat.  Consequently, there are no grounds to proceed with charges in this case.Date:	September 23, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=485

,,Chatham-Kent,Ontario,The Complainant was eventually transported to the CKHA where he was diagnosed with serious injuries including a fractured arm,"In circumstances such as these, the criminal charge that warrants consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to s. 249(3)[1]of theCriminal Code. In R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that this offence requires that “the driving be dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place.” It may be that theSO’s manner of driving was dangerous because he drove onto an unstable surface in close range of the Complainant. The surface was not meant to be driven on and was unable on the day in question to provide the necessary traction for theSOto be able to control his vehicle.However, Beatty also made it clear that driving that presents a risk to the public, viewed on its own, is not enough to make out the criminal offence of dangerous driving. The manner of driving must also be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances.” Only then can a driver be considered morally blameworthy to the point where he or she is deserving of a criminal conviction. In these circumstances, there is simply insufficient evidence to conclude that theSO’s driving represented a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in his position. TheSOhad reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant had committed a theft contrary to s. 334 of theCriminal Codeand therefore was not acting unreasonably by trying to stop him. There is no evidence that theSO’s manner of driving leading up to the moment he approached and entered the grass was anything other than normal and prudent driving. It is clear, based on the evidence including the collision reconstructionist report,[2]that the vehicle entered the grass at a low speed and that theSOattempted to stop the vehicle as soon as it started sliding but was unable to due to the swampy conditions. While theSO’s decision to drive onto the grass had serious consequences, I do not believe this decision alone is enough to meet the high threshold required to find a marked departure from a reasonable person.  In the result, I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe theSOcommitted a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s injuries and the file will be closed.Date:	June 28, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=367

,Ottawa Police Service,Ottawa,Ontario,Paramedics were called to the scene and transported Complainant 1 Complainant 2 and Complainant 3 to hospital where they were treated for various fractures,"The offence that arises for consideration isdangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 249(3)[4]of theCriminal Code.  As a crime of penal negligence, the offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would have observed in the circumstances.  It is important to begin by noting that theSOwas within his rights under the regulation governing police pursuits[5]in the province in commencing a pursuit of the Cadillac.  He had information that the vehicle had been reported stolen and was entitled to seek to stop it to investigate a potential criminal offence.  The pursuit itself was very brief, transpiring over a distance of less than one kilometre and under a minute in time.  In that interval, theSOalerted the communications centre that he was in pursuit, provided information regarding his location and had his emergency lights activated.  The maximum speeds reached by theSOare of some concern.  For example, his cruiser was traveling in excess of 90 km/h at points along Lévis Avenue, a 40 and 50 km/h zone.  Similarly, though there was no direct evidence on this point, the fact that theSOlikely travelled through one or more stop signs without first bringing his vehicle to a complete stop is subject to legitimate scrutiny.  While theSOought to have stopped at the stop signs in compliance with section 136(1) of theHighway Traffic Act, there is no evidence to suggest that these indiscretions actually placed the safety of any uninvolved third parties in danger.  Having said that, theSO’s speed may well have contributed to the speeds reached by Complainant #1 as he tried to get away, contributing to his loss of control over the Cadillac that resulted in the collision.  While that may well be true, it is only true to an extent.  The fact remains that Complainant #1 was bent on escape and must assume the lion’s share of the responsibility for traveling as fast as he was.  In the final analysis, given the nature of theSO’s short-lived engagement with the Cadillac, I am unable to reasonably conclude that the officer conducted himself in a manner that reflected a marked deviation from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Bancroft,Ontario,nCause of Death\t The pathologist who carried out the post-mortem examination on the body of the Complainant determined that cause of death was due to a “Submental from the area under the chin Gunshot Wound Perforating Head and Brain,"The police officers who had followed the Complainant to Tuckers Road were acting within the scope of their legal duties when attempting to arrest the Complainant.  Moreover, their only “interaction” with the Complainant was whenSO#2 yelled out that the Complainant was under arrest and that he was to get out of the car and lay on the ground.  Given the circumstances,SO#2 had every right to issue this directive; nonetheless, before either police officer could say anything else or take any other action, the Complainant shot and killed himself.  I find that their conduct did not in any way fall outside of the parameter of what was legally appropriate in the circumstances and cannot provide the basis for believing that any criminal offence occurred, and as a result, no criminal charges will issue.Date:	February 22, 2019Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=242
,Toronto Police Service,Kingston,Ontario,n r\n The material facts in question are relatively clear on the weight of the reliable evidence collected by the SIU which included statements from the Complainant and the three subject officers as well as video recordings of the arrest and the events that preceded it On the evening in question the subject officers were on duty in plainclothes and part of a team investigating potential human trafficking as part of a police operation The team came across a pickup truck parked at the motel with licence plates that were registered as “unattached” They came to learn that the truck was being operated by guests staying at the motel Deciding that they would investigate the guests in relation to the potential theft of the truck the team developed a ruse to lure them out of their room A call was placed by SO 2 to the Complainant’s room advising the guests that they would have to attend at the motel front office to register their vehicle The guests staying in the room were the Complainant and his associate CW 3 Instead of going to the motel office the two exited their room and made their way onto the parking lot toward their vehicle and entered it As they did so WO 1 and WO 2 in their unmarked police sedan which had been situated in the same parking lot began to drive in the direction of the pickup truck It was their intention to stop the vehicle and investigate its occupants The two stopped their sedan in the vicinity of the truck and approached it on foot as it began to reverse out of its parking spot The officers announced themselves as police officers and directed them to stop The Complainant paused briefly but then accelerated rearwards before coming to a stop and moving forward around the unmarked police sedan As it did so the Complainant came upon a minivan being operated by SO 1 The officer had positioned his van in an attempt to block the pickup truck The Complainant continued forward and the vehicles collided The Complainant maneuvered past SO 1’s van and collided with another unmarked police minivan this one driven by SO 3 The collision resulted in the pickup truck being wedged between SO 3’s minivan on its passenger side and a pillar supporting a roof extending over the front office area of the motel on its driver side Following the pickup truck’s collision with SO 3’s minivan officers rushed toward the driver side of the truck with their firearms drawn and pointed at the Complainant They ordered him out of vehicle but the driver door was jammed shut against the pillar SO 1 struck and broke the driver door window with his police radio and together with the assistance of SO 3 and SO 2 the latter having approached the scene on foot pulled the Complainant out through the window and forced him onto the ground Face down and refusing to surrender his hands the Complainant struggled against the officers’ efforts to restrain him in handcuffs The subject officers were concerned that the Complainant might be armed with a firearm and used force to secure the Complainant’s arms as quickly as possible During the struggle SO 3 positioned on the Complainant’s right side punched the Complainant’s right side multiple times and delivered several elbow strikes SO 2 on the Complainant’s left side kicked him once to the torso and then kneed him three times and SO 1 using his handgun struck the Complainant’s back once Once the Complainant was handcuffed he was sat against one of the motel’s pillars waiting for an ambulance to arrive n,"While I appreciate that there is conflicting evidence from the witnesses regarding the level of the Complainant’s resistance, I am unable to accept evidence that the Complainant was not resisting arrest. This evidence either comes from a source who would not be well positioned to see the Complainant’s level of resistance, or is belied by other witnesses and the video recording.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability for force used in the course of their duties provided the force in question is no more than is reasonably necessary in the execution of an act they are required or authorized to do by law.  I accept that the officers were proceeding to lawfully arrest the Complainant at the time that force was used to extract him from the car and effect his arrest.  The officers were entitled to approach the Complainant andCW#3 to investigate them for potential offences under theHighway Traffic ActandCriminal Codegiven information in their possession regarding the “unattached” licence plates that were affixed to the pickup truck in question.  Thereafter, when the Complainant attempted to elude the officers in his vehicle, leading to two collisions in the process and endangering the lives of the officers in those vehicles as well as his own and that ofCW#3, they were further within their rights in seeking to arrest him.With respect to the force that was used against the Complainant, I am unable to reasonably conclude that it was excessive in the circumstances.  The Complainant had just caused two motor vehicle collisions in a very apparent attempt to avoid the police.  His resolve to escape police apprehension and to resort to violence in the process were clear.  On this record, it seems to me the officers acted reasonably in breaking the driver door window of the Complainant’s pickup truck when the driver door would not open, pulling the Complainant through the window and forcing him to the ground.  Once on the ground, the Complainant resisted his arrest and refused to surrender his arms.  By this time, the officers knew who they were dealing with precisely, which information gave them heightened concern that the Complainant might be armed with a gun.  The subject officers responded to the Complainant’s resistance with force of their own, namely, multiple punches, and elbow and knee strikes; a kick; and, use of their combined manpower to wrestle the Complainant into submission.  While not an insignificant use of force, I am reasonably satisfied that it fell within the range of what was necessary to overcome the Complainant’s resistance in light of the Complainant’s demonstrated violence immediately before and during his arrest, and the officers’ well-grounded fears that he may have a firearm in his possession.  In arriving at this conclusion, I am mindful that police officers, in the heat of the moment, are not expected to measure their responsive force to a nicety; what is required is a reasonable response, not an exacting one:R. v.

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,n r\n The information collected in the course of the SIU’s investigation which included statements from the SO and a couple of CWs and a video recording of the pursuit allowed investigators to piece together the events in question Just before 5:30 p.m the SO was traveling west on Highway 401 west of Victoria Park Avenue when his attention was drawn to the Complainant The Complainant was just ahead of the officer also traveling west in the collector lanes of the highway The officer took note of the motorcycle’s licence plate and learned that it had expired in February 2018 and was unattached Intending to stop the Complainant to investigate potential Highway Traffic Act HTA infractions the SO followed the motorcycle with his emergency lights activated positioned his cruiser in behind the Complainant’s vehicle and signaled him to pull over by activating his siren The Complainant reacted by accelerating away from the cruiser prompting the SO to maneuver into the passing lane in an effort to keep pace with the motorcycle The SO managed to pull ahead of the Complainant and with traffic behind him responding to the cruiser’s lights and siren by slowing and stopping performed a U-turn on the highway west of Leslie Street such that the cruiser came to a stop facing east in the northern most collector lane The Complainant observed the cruiser ahead of him turned his bike around and accelerated east against the flow of traffic He quickly made his way onto the westbound on-ramp to the highway from the southbound lanes of Leslie Street where he collided with the Toyota vehicle operated by CW 2 The SO having observed the Complainant driving the wrong way performed another U-turn and traveled west along Highway 401 until again bringing his cruiser to a stop on the northern shoulder of the highway in the area of the Bayview Avenue off-ramp The officer soon learned of the motorcycle crash involving the Complainant r\n\r\n,"The offence that arises for consideration in this case is dangerous driving causing death contrary to then section 249(4) of theCriminal Code.[1]There are aspects of theSO’s conduct that might well be characterized as dangerous.  Performing a U-turn on a busy highway is a risky proposition at the best of times.  The officer also reached speeds as high as 150 km/h as he pursued the Complainant, well in excess of the 100 km/h speed limit on the highway.  Both behaviours were arguably exacerbated by the fact theSOwas chasing a motorcyclist for what were non-criminalHTAoffences.  Moreover, the officer may also have run afoul of the provincial regulation governing police pursuits (O. Reg. 266/10) when, for example, he failed to notify a dispatcher that a pursuit had been initiated.  On the other hand, the courts have made it clear that a breach of regulation will not necessarily ground liability with respect to offences of penal negligence, nor will a simple want of care suffice; the conduct in question must amount to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances: R v Beatty, [2008]1 SCR 49.  The U-turn executed by the officer across live lanes of highway traffic was ultimately performed safely after theSOhad assured himself that the motorists in the vicinity had stopped.  As for the officer’s speeds, it should be noted that theSOtopped out at about 150 km/h for about three seconds in the collector’s passing lane, and that his average speed from the moment he first signaled the Complainant to pull over until he started to slow down in preparation for the U-turn was roughly 130 km/h.  It should further be noted that it does not appear that traffic around the officer was ever forced to take evasive action.  Nor did theSOunduly push the Complainant; on the contrary, the Complainant had ample opportunity to come to a safe stop had he been so inclined.  In fact, the pursuit had come to an end when the Complainant decided to reverse course and drive the wrong way up the on-ramp from Leslie Street.  Finally, the pursuit in question was relatively brief in distance and duration, lasting about a minute and ten seconds over two kilometres, during which time the officer’s emergency lights were activated (as was his siren for the latter part of the pursuit), the road was dry and visibility was good.  On this record, I am persuaded on balance that theSO’s lapses in judgment, if they be such, fell short of transgressing the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.In the final analysis, I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSO’s conduct is connected to the Complainant’s death in any fashion giving rise to criminal liability.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Collingwood,Ontario,n r\n The material events in question are clear on the information collected by the SIU which included statements from the subject officers the Complainant and several firefighters in and around the area at the time as well as a cell phone video recording that captured the Complainant’s fall In the morning of October 8 2018 OPP officers arrived at the Complainant’s residence on Ontario Street to check on his well-being They had received a call about the Complainant barricading himself in his room The Complainant refused the officers entry into his bedroom and told them he was armed with knives With the mention of weapons the OPP mobilized its Emergency Response Team ERT and Tactics and Rescue Unit TRU The first TRU officers arrived at the scene between 10:00 and 10:30 a.m Among them were SO 1 and SO 2 As the two discussed options for entering the Complainant’s bedroom from the exterior of the building through the bedroom window other TRU officers gathered outside the Complainant’s bedroom door They asked the Complainant to come out of the room He refused told them he had knives and threatened to kill them SO 1 and SO 2 considered rappelling from the roof down to the bedroom window but abandoned that idea given the risk that the Complainant armed with knives might cut their rope Instead with the arrival of a fire services truck at the scene they decided to use the truck’s aerial bucket SO 1 and SO 2 entered the bucket and were raised into position by one of the firefighters The Complainant with knives in his possession waved them angrily in the officers’ direction as SO 1 and SO 2 approached the Complainant’s bedroom window SO 2 asked the Complainant to put the knives away and explained they were there to speak with him As the bucket became level with the Complainant’s window the TRU officers inside the apartment broke through the bedroom door with a battering ram Once inside the bedroom a stun grenade was deployed following which WO 4 discharged his ARWEN five times and WO 2 his CEW once for a cycle of 15 seconds At around the same time SO 2 aimed and fired his ARWEN five times in the Complainant’s direction though the bedroom window The CEW and ARWEN discharges failed to immobilize the Complainant perhaps in some measure because he was holding a mattress in front of him The Complainant jumped through the screen of his open bedroom window and with a knife in hand leapt toward the aerial bucket The Complainant never managed to make it inside the bucket He struck the front wall of the bucket and was grabbed by both SO 1 and SO 2 who attempted to hold him to prevent him from falling Neither officer was able to get a firm hold of the Complainant who slipped further down the bucket momentarily grabbing hold of the bucket’s lower ledge before losing his grip and falling to the ground Once on the ground the Complainant was approached by another TRU officer WO 3 The officer said he observed the Complainant with a knife in his hand and attempting to get up He shot the Complainant once with his ARWEN following which the Complainant was arrested and transported to hospital by paramedics.\n,"SO#2, had attempted to prevent him from falling.  For the reasons that follow, there are no reasonable grounds in my view to believe that either officer committed a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s injuries.There are two issues that require examination with respect to the officers’ potential criminal liability, namely, was the force used against the Complainant legally justified, and, did the officers cause or contribute to the Complainant’s injuries by way of criminal negligence.  Turning first to the issue of the officers’ use of force, section 25(1) of theCriminal Codeprovides that police officers are exempt from liability for force used in the course of their duties provided such force was reasonably necessary in the execution of an act that they were required or authorized to do by law.  The officers, including theTRUofficers, were lawfully in the area to take the Complainant into custody.  Whether pursuant to theMental Health Actor theCriminal Code, the Complainant was quite clearly suffering from a mental disorder at the time and in possession of knives with which he threatened to harm himself and others, and was clearly subject to legal apprehension.  The situation was fraught with danger, and the officers were entitled to proceed on the basis that the Complainant was ready and able to inflict grievous bodily harm or death given the opportunity.When a period of time had passed with the officers unable to convince the Complainant to exit his bedroom, they opted for a more aggressive posture.  I am unable to find fault with their decision to do so given the exigencies of the situation.  WhileSO#1 andSO#2 made their way up to the Complainant’s bedroom window from the outside, otherTRUofficers entered and immediately deployed force in an effort to disarm the Complainant.  Regrettably, despite the significant force that was expended, tenARWENrounds and aCEWdischarge, the Complainant retained possession of a knife and was able to jump through the window in an ill-fated attempt to land on the aerial bucket.  On this record, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the force used by the officers was measured, proportional to the threat at hand, and reasonably necessary in the circumstances.Once on the ground, the Complainant was struck with one furtherARWENdischarge.  This final shot is disconcerting.  ThoughWO#3 claims he saw a knife in the Complainant’s possession at the time, there is other evidence to suggest he had a single knife in his hands when he jumped, which fell ahead of him to the ground.  Be that as it may, the knife would at the very least have been close to the Complainant on the ground and reasonably accessible, and I am therefore prepared to giveWO#3 the benefit of the doubt on this issue given the volatility of the events around him.  In arriving at this conclusion, I have in mind the common law principle that affords police officers some latitude with respect to the force they adopt in dynamic circumstances; what is required is a reasonable response, not an exacting one.This leaves for consideration the issue ofcriminal negligence causing bodily harmcontrary to section 221 of theCriminal Code, which may be dealt with in short order.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial deviation from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised.  Without dealing again with the force that was used, which I believe is best resolved under section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, I have no hesitation in finding that theTRUofficers, includingSO#1 andSO#2, conducted themselves throughout the standoff with the Complainant in a professional manner.  They attempted to negotiate with the Complainant, to no avail.  It was apparent that the Complainant was not in a sound state of mind, and a more proactive approach was in order.  They considered their options and decided to forcibly enter the bedroom whileSO#1 andSO#2 approached the room from its only other access point.  While that tactic may have prompted the Complainant to jump through the bedroom window, I am satisfied it was one reasonably open to the officers.  Finally, when the Complainant leapt in the direction of the aerial bucket,SO#1 andSO#2, at risk to their own safety, did what they could to grab hold of the Complainant and prevent his fall.  In the final analysis, the officers’ conduct in my view leaves no room to reasonably conclude that they transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.In the result, there being no reasonable grounds to believe the officers used excessive force or were otherwise criminally negligent, there is no basis to proceed with charges in this case and the file is closed.Date:	September 13, 2019Joseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=465

,York Regional Police,York,Ontario,Surgery was required to repair the fractured patella but the Complainant refused to sign the necessary consent form resulting in her only being treated with pain medications following which she was discharged from hospital,"At 11:25:17 a.m., the police were dispatched to attempt to locate the Complainant.  Initially, seven police officers were dispatched and the Complainant’s cell phone was “pinged” usingGPStechnology, in order to attempt to locate the Complainant. 34 units in total, were eventually dispatched prior to this matter being resolved.At 11:32:25 a.m., theYRPcall taker placed a call to the Complainant’s cellular phone and spoke to the Complainant; the Complainant, during the course of the call, told the call taker, “I’m going to do an armed robbery and I’m going to force the police to … I’m going to come at you with a machete and I want you to shoot me.  I want to die and I can’t do it myself and I’m going to give you no choice.  Don’t call me again, you will hear from me soon.”Following this call, unfortunately, the Complainant disposed of her cell phone in the parking lot, following which she made her way through a forested area at the rear of the Canadian Tire store on Woodbine Avenue.Two additional 911 calls were received by theYRPCC almost simultaneously, shortly after 1:22 p.m., with the first call reporting that a suspicious person had been seen walking past the public school on Carrick Avenue with something in her hands, while a second 911 caller reported that a female had jogged north on Carrick Avenue and was now lying down on the front lawn of a residence at the corner of Carrick Avenue and Tuch Drive, in the Community of Keswick.  The 911 caller further reported that the woman was holding a knife.At 1:24:26 p.m., a radio transmission was sent out to all units repeating the information received in the various 911 calls and, at 1:28:30 p.m., Witness Officer (WO) #1 responded that he was en route with a tactical paramedic.At 1:30:05 p.m., a radio transmission was received fromWO#1 stating that the Complainant was in custody and that an ambulance was required.  The Complainant was then transported to the hospital, by ambulance, where she was assessed, and it was discovered that she had sustained transverse fractures to the right patella (kneecap).During the course of this investigation, in addition to the Complainant, six civilian and six police witnesses were interviewed; while Subject Officer (SO) #1, one of two designatedSOs in this matter, declined to be interviewed, the second subject officer,SO#2, consented to an interview.  In addition to the eyewitness evidence,SIUinvestigators had access to, and reviewed, the memorandum book notes of all the witness police officers, as well as the communications recordings, the 911 calls, and the Complainant’s medical records.  There is no dispute as to the facts.Following the making of the above-noted call to the Crisis Counsellor at the YRVS, and being informed by the counsellor that the counsellor would have to notify the police because of what the Complainant had disclosed to the counsellor about her intentions, the Complainant disposed of her cell phone in the bushes in order to thwart the efforts of the police to locate her.  She then returned to the motor vehicle that she had been using and took a machete, which the Complainant described as being 18 inches to 2 feet in length, and a bottle of whisky, which she then consumed until she became intoxicated.  The Complainant then entered a forested area, while still carrying both the machete and the bottle of whisky.Between the time of the first 911 call, and the Complainant’s subsequent arrest,YRPofficers set up a perimeter around the forested area where the Complainant had concealed herself, while making numerous effort to communicate with the Complainant, without any response from her.Eventually the Complainant left the forested area in the opposite direction, and began to walk on Carrick Avenue.  Upon arriving in the area of Carrick Avenue and Tuch Drive, the Complainant was observed by an independent civilian witness,CW#3, staggering on the sidewalk and speaking with herself, while carrying the sheathed machete in one hand and the bottle of whisky in the other.CW#3, who began following the Complainant in his motor vehicle, observed the Complainant then ‘hide’ under a tree on the southwest corner of Carrick Avenue and Tuch Drive, and he contacted theYRPCC and notified them of the Complainant’s location and kept them updated as to what she was doing.CW#3 observed a markedYRPMarine Unit vehicle, driven byWO#6, arrive andCW#3 pointed out to the officer where the Complainant was hiding.WO#6 was observed to approach the Complainant, to within ten to 15 feet of her location, and direct her to get down onto the ground;CW#3 indicated thatWO#6 had not drawn any use of force options.  When the Complainant yelled atWO#6 to, “Back away, I’ll kill you, I don’t want to kill you but I will kill you, just leave me alone, back away!”,WO#6 began to back up to his vehicle, while the Complainant aggressively came out from under the tree and walked towardsWO#6, while swinging the sheathed machete inWO#6’s direction.A markedYRPvehicle with a team from the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), which consisted ofSO#2,SO#1 andWO#4, then arrived at the Complainant’s location and all three officers exited the vehicle dressed in their tactical uniforms.CW#3 heard one of the officers address the Complainant by her first name and tell her, “We do not want to hurt you,” at which point the Complainant turned to face the officers and raised the machete in her right hand.  At that same moment,CW#3 heard a shot ring out and saw thatSO#1 was holding a long gun, which had smoke coming from the end of the barrel.  The Complainant then said, “Ow”, following which she fell to the ground and the three officers moved in to gain control over her.CW#5, the Advanced Care tactical paramedic who was called in to assist the Complainant, observed that there was a machete and an empty bottle of whisky lying on the grass about two metres east of the Complainant, after theARWEN(Anti-Riot Weapon Enfield)had been deployed, and that the Complainant was hysterical and was shouting and crying.  WhenCW#5 moved in to assess the Complainant, he saw that she was extremely intoxicated, was slurring her words, and had the odour of alcohol on her breath.  WhenCW#5 examined the Complainant’s knee, he found a minor abrasion on the right knee and a bit of a divot or imprint on her kneecap.The evidence ofSO#2, and the police witnesses interviewed, is consistent with that of these twoCWs.SO#2 stated that on October 3, 2018, at approximately 12:36 p.m., he andWO#4 andSO#1, of the Emergency Response Unit (ERU), responded to a call for service regarding a suicidal female who was armed with a machete and had threatened to harm herself by committing an armed robbery and who would then advance on police with the machete in order to force a confrontation with the police, who she hoped would then shoot her.Following receipt of information that the Complainant had been seen in the area of Carrick Avenue and Tuck Drive, theERUteam drove directly to that location. While en route,SO#2 instructedSO#1 to arm himself with the long range, less lethal,ARWENandWO#4 was to arm himself as back up with his less lethal Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW), whileSO#2 would provide lethal coverage, with his AR 15 rifle.As they approached the intersection of Carrick Avenue and Tuch Drive,SO#2 saw the Complainant at the bottom of a large tree on a side lawn of a residence on Carrick Avenue, just south of Tuch Drive;SO#2 saw that the Complainant had a machete in her right hand and a bottle in her left.All threeERUofficers then exited their vehicle andSO#2 described himself as going north on Carrick Avenue, toward Tuch Drive, whileSO#1 andWO#4 went around the south side of the tree.SO#2 then saw the Complainant, who was shouting obscenities, break into a slight jog heading away from the officers, withSO#1 andWO#4 repeatedly directing the Complainant to drop the knife.SO#2 then described the Complainant as turning to faceWO#4 andSO#1, while continuing to jog backwards, andSO#2 shouted out, “Legs, legs, legs!” in order to alertSO#1, who was some ten to 15 yards east of the Complainant, to target the Complainant’s leg area with hisARWEN.SO#2 explained that his thinking was that they could not allow the Complainant, while still armed with the machete, to get away from them and possibly confront another police officer, a citizen, or children from the nearby school.Within two seconds of his shout,SO#2 then heard one discharge of theARWEN, and the Complainant crumpled to the ground, dropping the machete as she did so, followed by the officers moving in and containing the Complainant.SO#2 further explained that, ultimately, it was the decision ofSO#1 whether or not he felt it was safe to fire theARWENat the Complainant, despite his direction toSO#1 to do so.  He further explained that when using anARWEN, areas to be avoided included the genitalia, spine, head, stomach and chest, while it was preferable, ideally, to target areas with heavy musculature.  Unfortunately, while the Complainant was still moving at the time that she was struck by theARWENprojectile, the accuracy of theARWENcould not be guaranteed, although it is generally effective from a range of up to 30 yards.SO#2 further opined that it would have been unsafe for any police officer to approach the Complainant, while she was armed with the machete, and to attempt to utilize either a baton or oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray.WO#6 observed the Complainant run away from theERUofficers, after they initially arrived and were directing her to get down and to drop the knife.  She then stopped and turned to face the officers, while still armed with the machete and shouting obscenities, at which pointWO#6 sawSO#1 discharge hisARWEN, which appeared to strike the Complainant in the right knee, and she fell, dropping the machete.WO#4, who had been directed to arm himself with hisCEW, stated that when the Complainant stood up and began shouting obscenities at him, while swinging the machete wildly back and forth, he felt that resort to hisCEWwould not be successful, as the maximum range for a successful deployment was approximately 25 feet, and the Complainant was already some 20 feet away and was increasing that distance when she began to jog off.  When the Complainant then turned around to again face the officers, with the machete in her right hand across her chest area and the bottle of whisky in her left hand, while continuing to shout obscenities,WO#4 heardSO#2 shout to target the Complainant’s legs, following which, within one to two seconds,SO#1 discharged hisARWEN, and a projectile struck the Complainant in the right thigh or knee area, following which she cried out in pain and fell to the ground, with the machete still clutched in her right hand.WO#4 andSO#1 then moved closer, while ordering the Complainant to drop the knife, which she then did by throwing it behind her;WO#4 then moved in and kicked the machete further away, following which the Complainant was handcuffed.The Complainant’s medical records appear to confirm the above, in that they read, “Patient says she came at police with a machete hoping they would shoot her as she could not kill herself and wanted police to do it for her.”On these facts, then, which are not disputed, I find that the Complainant, for the purpose of forcing a confrontation between herself and the police, armed herself with a machete in the hopes that she would be shot and killed by police, thereby allowing her to attain her goal of committing suicide.  It is also clear that the the response of theERUteam was that two out or three of the responding officers were equipped with less lethal use of force options, withSO#1 arming himself with anARWEN, whileWO#4 was armed with aCEW, and that onlySO#2 armed himself with a lethal use of force option, his AR 15 rifle, should all else fail.On all of the evidence, it is further established that police officers repeatedly shouted at the Complainant to drop her weapon, and thatSO#1 only discharged hisARWENwhen the Complainant turned to face them, while still armed with the machete, which she was swinging about and at the officers.  Only then, and only on one single occasion, didSO#1 discharge hisARWEN, which was successful in bringing the Complainant to the ground, where she voluntarily then disposed of the machete.  Once the Complainant was on the ground, no further use of force was resorted to by any police officer.Because it is clear, on this record, that the Complainant sustained a serious injury during her interaction with police, an assessment is required to determine whether or not the actions ofSO#1 andSO#2, in apprehending, disarming, and arresting the Complainant, amounted to an excessive use of force in the circumstances thereby vitiating their protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25 (1) of theCriminal Code.Pursuant to s. 25(1), a police officer, if he or she acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order for the two subject officers to qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that they were in the execution of a lawful duty, that they were acting on reasonable grounds, and that they used no more force than was necessary.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is evident from the information provided by the various 911 callers, that theERUteam, as well as all of the responding police officers, had reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was in possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace (s. 88 of theCriminal Code) and that her intent was to force a deadly confrontation with the police.  As such, the apprehension and subsequent arrest of the Complainant was legally justified in the circumstances.An assessment of the use of force resorted to by the two subject officers, then, requires an assessment of whetherSO#2’s direction toSO#1 that he ought to target the Complainant’s “Legs, legs, legs!”, andSO#1’s response in discharging hisARWENon one occasion, striking the Complainant in the knee cap, amounted to an excessive use of force.   On these facts, which are undisputed, I cannot find that these actions, despite the injury to the Complainant, amounted to an excessive use of force.  In fact, I find that the actions of these three officers, and all of the officers who interacted with the Complainant, exhibited calm, patience, and professionalism, and that no more than the minimal force required was used to contain and disarm the Complainant, before anyone came to harm.While we are without the benefit ofSO#1’s thinking with respect to why he opted to discharge hisARWEN, I find thatSO#2’s reasoning in this regard, based on the same information thatSO#1 had in his possession at the time, was prudent, and resulted in a safe outcome to the situation with resort to only the minimum force required to end the risk that the Complainant continued to pose while she was armed with the weapon.  In this regard, I accept thatSO#2’s concern that the police could not allow the Complainant, while still armed with the machete, to get away from them and possibly confront another police officer, a citizen, or children from the nearby school, was valid.  I accept as well his conclusion, which was both well thought out and appropriate to the circumstances, that it would have been unsafe for any police officer to approach the Complainant, while she was armed with an edged weapon, in an attempt to use either a baton orOCspray to disarm her.   I have no reason to believe thatSO#1’s thinking, which would have been based on the same information, would have been any different.In coming to this conclusion, I have considered the direction from the Supreme Court of Canada as set out inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.In conclusion, while the Complainant sustained her serious injury when she was struck by anARWENprojectile, the evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe the discharging of theARWENamounted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances, or that any of the involved officers acted outside of the limits of the criminal law when they disarmed and apprehended an unstable, potentially violent woman, who was armed with a dangerous weapon, and who had made clear her intentions to force a violent confrontation with police in order to end her own life.  On the evidence of all of the witnesses, and the Complainant herself, I have no hesitation in finding that all of the responding police officers acted with patience in their dealings with the Complainant, in efforts to bring a potentially lethal situation to a safe and satisfactory ending, without the loss of life.  As such, as I lack the bases for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	February 5, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=220

The situation was an emergency and the officers did what they could to abort what clearly was an intention on the part of the Complainant to end her life.  Based on their observations of the Complainant from ground level, the officers correctly deduced the location of the Complainant’s unit and wasted no time in making their way there.  Once on the balcony and sensing an opportunity to safely take hold of the Complainant,SO#1 grabbed her collar and attempted to rein her in.  I am satisfied that action, while precipitating the chain of events culminating in the Complainant’s jump, was a reasonable tactic in the circumstances.  The Complainant reacted by pulling him toward her and then pushing off against the officer.  That sequence placedSO#1’s life in danger as he struggled to maintain his grip on the Complainant and was dragged toward the railing, his balance secured bySO#2 from behind.  All told,SO#1 was on the balcony with the Complainant for a matter of seconds before she jumped.  On this record, I am satisfied the subject officers acted at all times with due care and regard for the Complainant, and in pursuit of their foremost duty – the protection and preservation of life.  Consequently, there are no grounds to believe that either officer is criminally implicated in the Complainant’s self-inflicted death, and the file is closed.Date:	September 6, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=447

The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that deviates markedly from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  The officers involved in the pursuit of the Avenger, including theSO, were acting in the lawful discharge of their duties.  They had information that the vehicle had been reported stolen and were within their rights in attempting to stop it for investigation of its occupants.From the moment it appears the driver of the Avenger became aware he was being followed, on Dunn Avenue, until the collision, the Avenger had travelled a distance of approximately 1.5 kilometres.  During that time, the roads were dry, the weather was clear and there was little if any vehicular or pedestrian traffic along the pursuit route.  TheSO, with his cruiser’s emergency lights on for most of his engagement with the Avenger, travelled at moderate speeds and kept a fair distance back of the Avenger; a construction worker at the site of the collision estimated the first cruiser arrived on scene within ten to 20 seconds of the Avenger.  In the circumstances, it is clear the driver of the Avenger had every opportunity to bring his vehicle to a safe stop had he been so inclined.With respect to the attempted block of the Avenger, and theSO’s participation in the maneuver, it was in my view a reasonable tactic.  The Avenger, while refusing to stop for the police, had to that point been traveling at moderate speeds without endangering traffic around it, leaving the officers to reasonably conclude its driver might surrender without incident once surrounded.  The tactic was also performed while the Avenger had slowed to make a turn and without any contact being made between the police vehicles and the AvengerWhile theSOought to have brought his cruiser to a complete stop before traveling through the stop sign as he turned left from Rideau Street to proceed north on Lansdowne Avenue, the officer did slow his vehicle appreciably before completing the turn and did so safely without endangering anyone’s safety.  Similarly, though the officer drove the wrong way north on Macdonell Avenue in pursuit of the Avenger, he did so for a short distance (about 360 metres), at low speed and in safety.On the aforementioned record, in the context of a brief engagement during which theSOwas the lead vehicle in a low speed pursuit of the Avenger over a distance of about one kilometre, there are no reasonable grounds to believe the subject officer transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.Date:	September 13, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=487

,Ontario Provincial Police,Richmond Hill,Ontario,n\nCause of Death nThe pathologist at the Complainant’s post-mortem examination attributed the Complainant’s death to “multiple blunt force injuries”,"The offence that arises for consideration iscriminal negligence causing deathcontrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised.  In the circumstances of this case, the key question in the liability analysis is whether the officers and, in particular, theSO, did enough in their efforts to locate the Complainant when they attended at the site of the motorcycle.[2]TheSO,WO#2 andWO#3 were immediately alert to the possibility of an injured motorcyclist and set about searching the area in the vicinity of the motorcycle on foot.  Regrettably, their search area appears to have been confined to something less than 100 metres from the motorcycle’s location, during which they found nothing of note.  Perhaps they should have widened their foot search, but their decision to not do so was in some respects understandable.  They had examined the motorcycle and, coming to the conclusion that it was not badly damaged, appear to have assumed its rider had simply abandoned the vehicle.  They had no reason to suspect the unusual sequence of events that saw the motorcycle travel, without an operator, more than 200 metres from the point of first impact across Highway 404, a fact that was only reinforced whenWO#3 travelled the ramp in his cruiser and found nothing of note.  Beyond the foot and cruiser searches that were performed, the officers also arranged from the scene to have the registered owner of the motorcycle contacted, and learned that he had sold the bike five years earlier.  Ought the officers and theSO, the senior officer on scene, have done more?  Perhaps. One can imagine that the Complainant might have been found, and medical care administered, far sooner than occurred had the officers expanded their search and/or brought other resources to bear to assist in their efforts, such as a police dog or aerial surveillance equipment.  Be that as it may, when one weighs what the officers did against what more they might have done, I am unable to reasonably conclude that their conduct transgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  Accordingly, there are no reasonable grounds for proceeding with criminal charges against the subject officer.Date:	October 2, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=519

,Ontario Provincial Police,Goderich,Ontario,The Complainant was subsequently taken to hospital and treated for his wound,"In the absence of legal justification, theSO’s act of shooting the Complainant would certainly attract criminal sanction.  While those justifications are ordinarily to be found in section 25 of theCriminal Code, providing for the justified use of force by police officers in the course of their duties, I am not persuaded that they pertain in this case.  If one begins at the outset, there are to my mind real questions surrounding the propriety of theSO’s initial intervention with the Complainant.  While it must be granted that the circumstances in which the Complainant exited the BMW would obviously arouse a level of suspicion, I am not confident that theSOwas possessed of the requisite reasonable suspicion that the Complainant was implicated in criminal activity such as would warrant an investigative detention:R. v. Mann, [2004] 3 SCR 59.  The Complainant, after all, was the passenger in the vehicle of interest and simply standing on a front yard with a couple of bags when he was confronted and detained by theSO; enough for a hunch that he was engaged in criminal activity, but perhaps nothing more.  In these circumstances, if there is truth in the proposition that theSOwas not in the lawful execution of his duties at the time of the shooting, then he is disqualified from the justifications set out in section 25 of theCriminal Code.  That said, an officer who detains an individual without reasonable grounds does not necessarily forfeit the right to defend him- or herself where threatened with lethal force.Pursuant to section 34 of theCriminal Code, a person whose conduct otherwise constitutes an offence is shielded from liability if the conduct in question was intended to repel threatened or actual force against oneself or another, reasonably apprehended, and the conduct was reasonable in the circumstances.Starting with the more incriminating version of events as regards the officer’s criminal liability, I am not satisfied it reasonably gives rise to a finding that the shooting was unjustified.  There is no question the Complainant refused to cooperate with the officer and repeatedly reached into his pocket despite theSO’s directions that he not do so.  The Complainant may well have been entitled to resist what might have been an unlawful detention.  However, in so doing, he caused the officer to begin to harbour concerns for his safety.  It was late at night, theSOwas alone and the Complainant had just exited a vehicle under suspicious circumstances.  The Complainant’s hostility toward theSObegan to rise and he demanded the officer shoot him, a provocative challenge that would only have heightened the officer’s fear.  Thereafter, when he reached with his right hand into his vest pocket to remove two shotgun cartridges and, ignoring theSO’s exhortation that he stop moving, extended his right arm in the officer’s direction, one can reasonably infer that the officer believed that a weapon was about to be used against him with potentially lethal results.  On this account, theSOwould have been mistaken in his apprehension as the Complainant did not have a firearm.  That mistake, however, would in my view have been a reasonable one to make in the circumstances.  On this record, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that theSOreasonably resorted to lethal force to meet what he legitimately believed was a lethal threat to his life.  In arriving at this conclusion, I note that officers embroiled in dangerous situations are not expected to measure their use of force with precision; rather, they are accorded some leeway in recognition of the dynamics and exigencies of the moment:R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 SCR 206;R. v. Baxter(1975), 27 CCC (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.).The description of events proffered by theSO, being less inculpatory in my view, necessarily results in the same legal conclusion.  In this case, one has the spectre of an individual who, having informed the officer that he was carrying a firearm in his backpack, refused repeated commands to drop the backpack and instead turned in the officer’s direction while reaching into the bag.  This gesture, I am satisfied, left theSOwith little choice but to resort to deadly force to thwart what he reasonably perceived was a threat to life and limb.  It is true that theSOnever says he actually saw a firearm in the Complainant’s possession; he merely presumed as much given what he had heard and seen from the Complainant.  That presumption, however, was a reasonable one in the circumstances and gave legitimacy to the officer’s act of self-defence.  One does not expect individuals in fraught situations to wait to see a firearm pointed in their direction before they act to protect themselves where they otherwise reasonably believe that the risk of their being shot is real and imminent.As for what actually occurred in the moments that immediately preceded the shooting, there is reason to suspect that neither account provides a full picture.  An independent witness provided a statement that contradicted both accounts in some respects. There are other such discrepancies, some bolstering the case in favour of theSO, others detracting from it, none of them, in my view, sufficiently weighty to tip the balance one way or the other in terms of potential charges against the officer.In the final analysis, as I am unable to form reasonable grounds on the evidence to believe that theSOtransgressed the limits of permissible force under section 34 of theCriminal Code, I am left without grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.

,London Police Service,London,Ontario,n r\n The collision occurred at about 12:22 a.m of the day in question on Leroy Avenue east of Taylor Street The SO was in the area responding to a report of a person walking up and down driveways with a flashlight The Complainant was that person He was significantly inebriated at the time and trying to find a residence At one point just after midnight the Complainant had laid down on the roadway and appeared to be using his mobile phone prompting a motorist to navigate around him The SO turned onto Leroy Avenue from Taylor Street and proceeded east along the roadway a short distance when the right front tire of his vehicle made contact with the Complainant who was lying across the roadway at the time The SO felt the impact quickly stopped his vehicle and arranged for an ambulance to attend the scene r\n\r\n,"The offences that arise for consideration arecriminal negligence causing bodily harmanddangerous driving causing bodily harmcontrary to sections 221 and 249(3)[1]of theCriminal Code, respectively.  Both offences are predicated, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances:R v Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49;R v F(J), [2008] 3 SCR 215.  TheSOwas acting in the course of his duties as he made his way onto Leroy Avenue to investigate a report of a possible prowler in the area.  The officer travelled a short distance at modest speed - in the neighbourhood of 20 km/h - east on Leroy Avenue when his vehicle collided with the Complainant.  The road was dry and in good repair, and there appears to have been no other motorists in the vicinity.  What remains unknown is whether the police vehicle’s headlights were on at the time.  If not, visibility in the area would have been significantly compromised, particularly as the street lighting was all but obscured by the trees lining the roadway.    It is also unclear why theSOdid not see the Complainant on the road when another motorist had been able to and managed to maneuver around him only moments earlier.  It may be that the Complainant was no longer using his mobile phone, the light from which may have alerted the earlier motorist to his presence, but this is sheer speculation.  Be that as it may, the officer had no reason to suspect that someone might take the sort of unusual action adopted by the Complainant, which knowledge might have necessitated greater precautions as he travelled on Leroy Avenue.  In the final analysis, I am satisfied on this record that it would be unreasonable to conclude that theSOtransgressed the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Nipissing,Ontario,The report of post-mortem examination dated May 7 2019 and received by the SIU on July 12 2019 attributed the Complainant’s death to a “close range gunshot wound to submentum perforating brain and penetrating head,"There is nothing in the information collected by theSIUto suggest that any of the police officers involved in the events culminating in the Complainant’s death ran afoul of the criminal law.  On the contrary, the evidence indicates they acted with professionalism and resolve in dealing with a situation that could well have escalated beyond its already tragic dimensions.  The officers were in the lawful discharge of their duties as they responded to the scene.  They had information that the Complainant had shotCW#4 and her son, likely killing him, and was intent on doing more harm.WNPSofficers responded swiftly and took prompt action to block traffic and evacuate residents in the area.  They contained the scene for more than three hours until theOPP’sERTandTRUofficers began to deploy, during which time the Complainant fired shots in their direction.  With the arrival of theOPPand the tactical resources at their disposal, the police adopted a more aggressive posture as they moved in to search forCW#4’s son, and possibly render him medical assistance, and the Complainant.  With the use of unmanned aerial surveillance equipment, night vision goggles and a police dog, they located the two individuals, both deceased, in fairly short order.  At no point did any of the officers involved in the operation discharge a firearm.  While the Complainant appears to have shot himself at about 9:30 p.m.,[4]several hours before his body was discovered, I am satisfied that the involved officers moved with appropriate dispatch.  The officers had good cause to approach the situation with extreme caution; the Complainant’s propensity for lethal violence was apparent and the officers had every reason to believe that he remained a lethal threat up to the point he was found.In conclusion, there being no evidence to suggest that the conduct of the involved officers, including theSO, was anything other than reasonable throughout, much less that their conduct contributed to the Complainant’s self-inflicted death in any fashion that could attract criminal sanction, there are no grounds to proceed with charges and the file is closed.Date:	July 17, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=383

TheSOwas in the execution of his duties when he sought to take the Complainant into police custody.  The Complainant had just assaulted a couple of persons and made threats to harm others.  He was clearly subject to arrest.  The Complainant had made it clear that he would not be taken peacefully.  He threatened the officers as they travelled east along Hasbrooke Drive and told them they better resort to real firearms if they had any chance of stopping him.  Given what the officers knew of the Complainant’s recent violence, and the possibility he was in possession of a knife, they acted reasonably in my view in refusing to physically engage the Complainant, choosing instead to call for the assistance of officers equipped withCEWs to attend the scene.  With the arrival ofWO#7 and theSO, the Complainant was given yet another opportunity to get on the ground and submit to arrest.  He was even warned that he would be shot with aCEWif he did not comply.  The Complainant did not, and was stunned once byWO#7.  Undeterred by the first discharge, he was struck again by aCEWdischarge, this time by theSO.  Regrettably, the Complainant was incapacitated in the area of a set of stairs and fell down the stairs, striking his head on a metal rail at the side of the stairs.  TheSO, who was new to the area, indicated he was not aware of the stairs in the vicinity and might well have not discharged his weapon had he known, given the risk of the Complainant falling from a height.  I accept the officer’s evidence in this regard, particularly as it would have been dark at the time of the incident.On the aforementioned record, I am satisfied that the officers who engaged the Complainant gave him every opportunity to yield without force being used, and only resorted to force when it became clear that the Complainant would not give up and with the arrival of theCEWs at the scene.  In the circumstances, and notwithstanding the serious injuries the Complainant suffered, I am of the view that the twoCEWdischarges fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary to overcome the Complainant’s resistance and affect his arrest.  Consequently, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges against the subject officer and the file is closed.Date:	August 16, 2019Joseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=411

,South Simcoe Police Service,Grey,Ontario,The occupants of the pickup truck and the SUV were all taken by ambulance to hospital with serious injuries,"With respect to theSO’s potential criminal liability, the offences that arise for consideration aredangerous driving causing bodily harmandcriminal negligence causing bodily harmcontrary to sections 249(3)[1]and 221 of theCriminal Code, respectively.  Both offences are premised, in part, on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  But for the officer’s indiscretion in failing to stop at one, and possibly two, red lights, I am unable to find fault with the manner in which theSOconducted the police pursuit in question.  Though the officer exceeded the speed limit at points, travelling as fast as 110 km/h south on 10 Sideroad and 119 km/h west on Highway 88, he was engaged in the execution of his duties and therefore exempt from the speed limits (60 km/h and 80 km/h, respectively) pursuant to section 128(13) of theHighway Traffic Act.  This section does not confer carte blanche on officers to speed as they wish; they must at all times tailor their conduct in light of their foremost duty, namely, the safety of the public.  On this score, it is important to note that there is no evidence that other drivers were threatened by the manner in which the cruiser was operated, nor was it the case that theSO’s average speeds were grossly in excess of the speed limits.  TheSOhad grounds to initiate the pursuit under O. Reg. 266/10, being possessed of information that theSUV’s occupants had committed thefts from the Tanger Outlets.  He did so over a relatively short distance of about 4 kilometres during which he had his emergency lights activated, maintained a safe distance from theSUVthroughout, and updated the police communications centre with respect to his location, speeds and the behaviour of theSUV.  Turning west onto Highway 88, with the roads wet, heavy rain falling and visibility poor, the decision was made, reasonably in my view, to discontinue the pursuit.  Regrettably, theSUVcontinued its flight and caused a collision with an uninvolved motorist.On the aforementioned record, I am satisfied that theSO’s conduct fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  Pursuant to section 144(20) of theHighway Traffic Act, the officer ought to have come to a full stop before proceeding south on 10 Sideroad through the red light at Reagens Industrial Parkway.  It may be, though it is not entirely clear on the evidence, that theSOalso drove through a red light without stopping when turning right onto Highway 88.  In both cases, the officer slowed his cruiser with his emergency lights and siren on and made sure it was safe to proceed before continuing through the intersections.  Weighed in the balance with the totality of theSO’s driving behaviour, I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that the officer’s want of care in this regard was sufficient to render his conduct a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.  Consequently, there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges against theSOand the file is closed.Date:	August 19, 2019Joseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=425

,Toronto Police Service,Kingston,Ontario,Hussain’s death was a perforating gunshot wound of the head and brain,"TheSIU’s investigation consisted of interviews with 15 Civilian Witnesses (CWs) and seven Witness Officers (WOs), as well as a review of surveillance video and in-car camera system (ICCS) video footage which captured much of the incident. TheSIUalso obtained and reviewed Mr. Hussain’s post mortem report and a firearm’s report. The witness statements were overwhelmingly consistent with each other and the video and forensic evidence, and the relevant circumstances surrounding Mr. Hussain’s death are accordingly clear.TheTPSfirst became aware of an active shooter in Toronto on July 22, 2018, at 10:00 p.m. when a person called 911 to report that “someone had been shot on the Danforth” at Pappas Grill. The 911 communications center was immediately flooded with other callers reporting a shooting on Danforth Avenue and that people were running or injured. One caller indicated that the shooter, Mr. Hussain, had stood on top of a woman and shot her multiple times in the back. At 10:05 p.m., another caller reported that Mr. Hussain was heading westbound on Danforth Avenue and was in possession of a black handgun.WO#2 andWO#3 are the only responding officers known to have interacted with Mr. Hussain prior to his death. The officers were working together that night and shared a marked police cruiser.WO#3 was driving and they were near Broadview Street and Queen Street when they learned of an active shooter. The officers immediately responded and, at 10:06 p.m., they turned onto Bowden Street and drove northbound towards Danforth Avenue.WO#2 andWO#3 were heading north on Bowden Street when they witnessed Mr. Hussain standing on the west sidewalk of Bowden Street and shooting towards 7Numbers restaurant, located at the southeast corner of Danforth Avenue and Bowden Street.WO#2 saw Mr. Hussain extend his right arm towards 7Numbers restaurant and heard two gunshots.WO#3 noticed flashes of light coming from Mr. Hussain’s handgun and heard several loud bang sounds. Both officers exited their cruiser, drew their firearms and pointed them in the direction of Mr. Hussain. Mr. Hussain turned to faceWO#2 andWO#3 and, according to the officers, fired two to four shots in their direction.WO#3 told theSIUthat he feared for his life so he fired once or twice at Mr. Hussain. The forensic evidence indicates that he actually discharged three rounds.[2]He was unsure whether he hit Mr. Hussain or missed.WO#2 also returned fire and moved toward the back of the cruiser to take cover.WO#2 could not recall how many times he discharged his firearm, but gave estimates ranging from two to four shots.[3]In fact, the evidence suggests he discharged his firearm once, striking the frame of the rear passenger window and causing the window to shatter.I believe thatWO#2 andWO#3 are credible and their accounts of the incident quite reliable because their statements were overwhelmingly consistent with the remainder of the evidence, including the statements of multiple civilian witnesses who witnessed or heard the exchange of gunfire.WO#2 andWO#3’s statements were also supported by the video evidence which confirmed that Mr. Hussain discharged his firearm when he encountered the police officers. 7Numbers restaurant had a surveillance camera which captured Mr. Hussain on the west sidewalk of Bowden Street, walking towards Danforth Avenue. He appeared to be walking backwards and was facing in the direction of the police officers (who were not captured on video). Mr. Hussain raised his arms and a bright flash of light caused by a firearm discharge was clearly visible. He continued walking backwards and, four seconds later, another flash of light consistent with a firearm discharge was visible. TheICCSfootage fromWO#2 andWO#3’s police cruiser similarly captured Mr. Hussain discharging his firearm, but from a different perspective. The footage depicted Mr. Hussain standing on the west sidewalk of Bowden Street. At 10:06:40 p.m., a bright flash of light emanated from him consistent with a muzzle flash from a firearm. Between 10:06:40 p.m. and 10:06:46 p.m., four more muzzle flashes were seen. Finally, at 10:06:48 p.m., Mr. Hussain shifted his body slightly and another muzzle flash was seen.From the totality of this evidence, I accept that Mr. Hussain initially shot towards the people at 7Numbers restaurant before turning and shooting atWO#2 andWO#3, who almost immediately returned fire.TheICCSfootage also confirms that, after his interaction with the police, Mr. Hussain immediately ran north on Bowden Street and then west on Danforth Avenue until he disappeared from sight behind the Danforth Church, located at 60 Bowden Street at the southwest corner of Bowden Street and Danforth Avenue.WO#3 reported over the police radio that shots had been fired.WO#7 was in the area of Danforth Avenue and Logan Avenue, helping people with injuries, when he heardWO#3’s report. He drove to Bowden Street and, at 10:12 p.m., saw Mr. Hussain’s body on the sidewalk of Danforth Avenue, just west of Bowden Street. Mr. Hussain was laying on his back near the Danforth Church and had a significant injury to the right side of his head.WO#7 approached Mr. Hussain’s body and observed a shell casing next to his head, an empty magazine on the sidewalk and a black handgun in his right hand. According toWO#7, Mr. Hussain’s ring and pinkie finger were still around the grip of the gun andWO#7 moved the firearm away from Mr. Hussain. Mr. Hussain also had a satchel around his left shoulder, whichWO#7 searched. He found three more loaded magazines.Mr. Hussain’s post mortem report concluded that Mr. Hussain died of a contact range gunshot wound to the head and brain. The entry of the bullet occurred at the right temple of the head and a “muzzle stamp”[4]was present on the inferior portion of the wound. The bullet track traversed the brain from right to left and front to back and upwards and, as a result, the “injury would have been essentially immediately incapacitating and fatal.” There were no other significant injuries found to Mr. Hussain’s body.After a careful review of this evidence, I am satisfied that neitherWO#2 norWO#3 caused Mr. Hussain’s death. Mr. Hussain’s death was caused by a single bullet which traversed his brain and it is clear that neither officer is responsible for this wound. The post-mortem report stated that the wound would have immediately incapacitated Mr. Hussain; however, theICCSfootage clearly depicted Mr. Hussain running away from the officers after they shot at him. It would have been impossible for Mr. Hussain to run away as depicted if either officer had caused the injury to Mr. Hussain as observed in the post mortem report.  Given the evidence, including the results of the post mortem examination, I instead conclude that Mr. Hussain’s died at his own hands when he decided to shoot himself in front of the Danforth Church. The bullet’s entry was at contact range and to the right temple, indicative of a self-inflicted gunshot wound as a result of suicide. There were no bullet fragments found within Mr. Hussain’s head; however, a brass cartridge casing was found on the sidewalk near his body and forensic analysis concluded that that casing came from a bullet fired by the handgun found with Mr. Hussain.[5]Finally, there is no evidence suggesting that any other person shot Mr. Hussain, nor do I believe it likely that someone could have shot Mr. Hussain at contact range given that he was armed and prepared to use his gun. I am accordingly satisfied that the only reasonable inference based on this circumstantial evidence is that Mr. Hussain shot himself.With respect to the shots fired byWO#2 andWO#3, I am unable to form grounds to believe that either officer committed a criminal offence because their use of force fell within the scope of that permitted by law. Section 25(1) of theCriminal Codeallows police officers to use force in the course of their lawful duties so long as the officer acts on reasonable grounds and the force is necessary. Section 25(3) of theCriminal Codeimposes additional restrictions where the use of force is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm. The officer must believe the force is necessary to protect himself or herself, or another person, from death or grievous bodily harm and this belief must be both subjectively held by the police officer and objectively reasonable in the circumstances (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206). On these facts, I have no hesitation in finding that the shots fired byWO#2 andWO#3 fall within the scope of force permitted by ss. 25(1) and (3) of theCriminal Code.WO#2 andWO#3 were acting pursuant to their duty to protect life when they responded to a call indicating that there was an active shooter on Danforth Avenue. When they approached Danforth Avenue they observed Mr. Hussain firing towards people at a restaurant before turning to shoot at the officers. It is clear that both officers feared for their lives and for the lives of others, and it is similarly clear that this fear was objectively reasonable. Mr. Hussain was actively shooting at the officers, creating an immediate and significant threat, and I find that it was reasonably necessary for the police officers to discharge their firearms in an ultimately failed attempt to neutralize that threat.In conclusion, I am simply unable to find any evidence that a police officer committed a criminal offence in relation to Mr. Hussain’s death. Instead, I believe that Mr. Hussain decided to kill himself rather than surrender to police and findWO#2 andWO#3’s use of force was entirely appropriate in the circumstances. Accordingly, no charges will issue and the file will be closed.Date:	January 7, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=165
,Niagara Regional Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,n r\n The following scenario emerges from the weight of the evidence At about 4:30 a.m of the day in question the police received a 911 call from a resident of an apartment complex in St Catharines The caller described an incident in the parking lot of the complex involving a screaming woman who might have been forced into a van by a man or men wielding weapons Officers rushed to the scene spoke with the woman and learned that she had been assaulted by the Complainant who then fled the area This information was broadcast to other officers The SO and his police service dog were assigned to conduct a track of the vicinity to locate the Complainant while other officers were directed to establish a perimeter around the search area The police service dog on a leash and in the control of the SO quickly caught scent of the Complainant in the parking lot behind the apartment complex and tracked him north to the backyard of a home The SO was then led east across another backyard whereupon he observed the Complainant on the next lot over further east The Complainant ignored the SO’s direction that he stop and continued to flee in an effort to escape apprehension The chase continued east and then north along the rear of a Sobeys grocery store toward a barbed wire chain link fence The Complainant was in the process of trying to scale over the fence when he was grabbed by the SO and pulled down The SO ordered the police service dog to remain still as he attempted to arrest the Complainant The Complainant tried to free himself from the SO’s grip by pushing at the officer The two grappled for a period and fell to the ground where the struggle continued The SO gave the police service dog the order to physically engage the Complainant and the dog did so The police service dog who was nearby approached the Complainant and bit him in the neck and face areas whereupon the Complainant moved his hands up to the left side of his face After several seconds the SO called the police service dog off grabbed him by the harness and moved him away from the Complainant WO 1 who had accompanied the SO during the track and WO 4 who had found his way over to the arrest scene then moved in to handcuff the Complainant Paramedics were called to the scene and the Complainant who was bleeding from the face was taken to hospital He sustained multiple lacerations to the face and a couple of puncture wounds one of which was inflicted in the neck area n,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=401
,Ontario Provincial Police,Kingston,Ontario,n r\n There is some uncertainty around the circumstances of the Complainant’s arrest as the SO declined to be interviewed as was his legal right and there is limited evidence about what occurred What is known of the transaction is gleaned largely from the evidence of the second arresting officer who was present throughout the interaction and and a civilian eyewitness who happened upon the scene namely WO 4 and CW 2 as well as the data downloaded from the CEWs that were used At around 1:40 p.m the OPP received a call of a theft that had just been committed at a convenience store in the Town of Bath WO 4 attended the store and reviewed a security video recording which depicted the Complainant committing the theft The officer made her way to the Complainant’s address and located him in a lot outside the rear of his residence WO 4 asked to speak with the Complainant about the theft but he was not interested in discussing the matter When the officer told him he was under arrest for the theft the Complainant’s ire escalated and he started to push and grab at the officer WO 4 tried to reason with the Complainant but his behaviour was undeterred Having attempted and failed to ground the Complainant the officer drew her CEW and threatened to use it if the Complainant did not desist He did not and was met with a CEW discharge aimed at his upper chest The deployment only temporarily immobilized the Complainant He continued to come at WO 4 grabbing her wrists prompting the officer to discharge her CEW a second time Again the Complainant locked up for a short period but quickly resumed his combative behaviour WO 4 called for assistance and the SO was soon on scene The SO arrived to find the Complainant holding WO 4 from behind in a bear hug of sorts When the opportunity presented itself the SO deployed his CEW and then again when the first deployment though meeting its mark proved ineffective When the second discharge was of similar effect the SO drew his baton extended it and struck the Complainant a number of times The Complainant was felled by the strikes but still kept his arms clenched tightly underneath him as the officers attempted to secure him in handcuffs The SO and WO 4 were eventually able to wrest control of the Complainant’s arms and place him in handcuffs The Complainant was placed in the SO’s vehicle and then with its arrival an ambulance for transport to the hospital.\n,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=427

,Ottawa Police Service,Elgin,Ontario,n r\n The nature and extent of the Complainant’s dealings with various police officers on the day in question is clear based on the SIU’s investigation which included information derived from video recordings that captured his arrest and time in custody and statements from the Complainant the subject officers and a number of civilian eyewitnesses SO 1 and SO 2 were on bicycle patrol cycling north on the west sidewalk of King Edward Avenue when they observed the Complainant in and around the area of the SGHHS just south of Murray Street The Complainant was drunk and in a belligerent mood As SO 1 neared the Complainant confronted the officer and challenged him to a fight The officer pushed the Complainant away and got off his bicycle He spoke with people from SGHHS and learned that the Complainant had demonstrated aggressive and combative behaviour As the Complainant had nowhere else to go and SO 1 was concerned that the Complainant was a danger to himself and others given his violent behaviour the officer decided to arrest him for public intoxication SO 1 and SO 2 followed the Complainant inside the front doors of the shelter took hold of his arms and secured him in handcuffs after a brief struggle Thereafter the officers escorted the Complainant outside and placed him front-first against the wall just north of the shelter’s doors The time was now 2:40 p.m Over the next 20 minutes or so the Complainant repeatedly attempted to push himself off the wall and spat in SO 1’s direction SO 1 applied a wrist lock and ultimately took the Complainant to the ground in an effort to subdue him At around 3:50 p.m the Complainant was placed inside a police prisoner van and taken to the Elgin Street police station Shortly after being lodged in a cell the Complainant began punching the cell door with his right and left hands At about 6:00 p.m with a special constable standing outside his cell the Complainant held up his right hand and pointed to it Paramedics arrived at the cell around 6:20 p.m and transported the Complainant to hospital n,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=354
,Ontario Provincial Police,Hamilton,Ontario,n r\n On June 29 2018 at approximately 8:46 p.m the SO of the Haldimand County Detachment of the OPP was on routine patrol in a marked police vehicle when he observed a motorcycle operated by the Complainant approaching him from the opposite direction on Highway 6 travelling at a high rate of speed The SO clocked the motorcycle on his radar to be travelling at 119 km/h in a posted 80 km/h zone The SO performed a U-turn and followed the Complainant’s motorcycle with the intention of performing a vehicle stop According to the GPS data associated with the SO’s police cruiser the SO increased his speed to 152.89 km/h at its highest in the area of Hwy 6 north of Fourth Line in an attempt to catch up to the motorcycle As the SO approached the crest of a hill he activated his emergency lighting system and siren in order to alert other traffic of his presence and to signal to the Complainant to pull his motorcycle over Despite the increase in his cruiser’s speed the SO was unable to close the gap estimated between 200 and 400 metres between his police cruiser and the motorcycle as the Complainant was observed to also increase his speed As the SO approached Fifth Line when it became obvious that the Complainant was not going to stop his motorcycle the SO deactivated his emergency lights and siren and reduced his speed to 99.78 km/h He then radioed to alert another radar officer ahead that a motorcycle was heading his way travelling at a high rate of speed before further reducing his speed to the posted speed limit The SO continued northbound on Hwy 6 at the speed limit losing sight of the motorcycle Meanwhile the Complainant still travelling at a speed of approximately 200 km/h and approaching Argyle Street moved into the southbound lane of traffic in order to pass a northbound motorist lost control of his motorcycle as he steered back into the northbound lane and drove into the ditch striking a culvert and crashing his vehicle As the SO approached Argyle Street he rounded a curve in the roadway and observed the Complainant’s motorcycle in the ditch with other motorists having stopped to assist him The SO reactivated his emergency lighting system and rendered assistance to the Complainant who was obviously injured At no time did the SO’s police cruiser ever come into contact with the Complainant’s motorcycle nor is there any evidence that the SO was directly responsible for the Complainant’s collision.\n,"In the final analysis, in the context of theSO’s short-lived engagement in this matter, lasting about a minute over some two kilometres, there are no reasonable grounds in my view toconclude that the officer caused or contributed to the Complainant’s injuries in any fashion that could attract criminal liability.

,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,The Complainant was diagnosed with having a non-displaced radial styloid fracture intra-articular of the right wrist,"At the same time, civilian witness (CW) #5 was driving his red Scion travelling in the same area and in the same direction as theSO; the Complainant was his front seat passenger.It is not in dispute that just prior to coming to theSO’s attention,CW#5 wished to merge into the left lane, where theSOwas already located driving hisPRPvehicle, in order to make a left turn ahead.  It appears clear thatCW#5 was unaware, at that time, that the Jeep was a police vehicle or that it was being operated by a police officer.According toCW#5, as he attempted to change lanes, the Jeep sped up and closed the gap preventing him from merging, following whichCW#5 rolled down his window and made some comments to theSO.  The Complainant said, in her statement toSIUinvestigators, that she also observed her husband make hand gestures towards the other driver.CW#5 indicated that he then attempted to merge into the lane behind the Jeep, but as the Jeep was stationary, he was unable to do so.  When the traffic in front of the Jeep then moved ahead,CW#5 sped up and merged into the gap in front of the Jeep.  According to the Complainant, the Jeep was stationary, as the traffic light was red, and as soon as the light turned green, the traffic in front of the Jeep moved off and her husband then sped into the gap cutting off the Jeep.At that point, bothCW#5 and the Complainant stated that they heard sirens behind them, but saw no emergency lights.CW#5 indicated that the driver of the Jeep looked angry and he became scared.CW#5 indicated that as there were no markings or emergency lights on the Jeep, and theSOwas not wearing a police uniform, he did not know that he was a police officer.CW#5 and the Complainant both describedCW#5 as then panicking and racing off.From this point forward,CW#5 indicated, his memory was blurry and he had little recall as to what occurred other than that he drove onto Highway 410, and the Jeep followed behind.CW#5 described himself as scared and shaking, and that his hands and feet would not work and he was unable to use the brake or accelerator pedals correctly.CW#5 further described himself as being in shock and that he could not recall whether or not he drove fast.  He indicated that his feet were unresponsive and he recalled the sound of bangs and his car stopping and catching fire, whereupon he grabbed the hotdog buns that he had gone out to purchase, along with his wife’s cell phone, and got out of the car and ran, which he did for his own safety.  After leaving the vehicle, he ran to the roadside guard rail and fell over it.CW#5 deduced that since theSOarrived at the collision scene very quickly, that he must have been behind him all the way, although he appeared to have no recollection of that.  TheSOthen arrestedCW#5 at gunpoint and told him that he, theSO, had tried to pullCW#5 over becauseCW#5 had cut him off, butCW#5 did not remember a lot about what happened.DespiteCW#5’s claim that he could not recall whether or not he was driving fast, I note that in the ambulance call reports it is noted that he told the paramedics that he was “involved in high speedMVC” (motor vehicle collision) and that he struck a second vehicle at approximately 120 km/h when he was exiting off the Highway 410 ramp at Mayfield Road.The Complainant, who did not suffer any difficulties with her memory, stated that when her husband sped off, theSOaggressively chased after them, with her husband saying something to the effect that they could not go back to her house, but he would go up Highway 410 to Mayfield Road and then loop back.  She describedCW#5 as headed north on Highway 410 towards Mayfield Road, with theSOvery close behind them, and that her husband commented that the Jeep was “right on my bumper” and that he could not brake or the Jeep would hit him.  The Complainant described their drive on the highway as, “over the speed limit” and, “a full on race”; estimating her husband’s speeds as being at 100 to 110 km/h, with theSOdriving at the same speed with his emergency siren activated.  The Complainant went on to clarify that theSOremaining right on their bumper meant that he was about one car length behind.CW#5, she indicated, then dodged around cars as he exited the highway and approached Mayfield Road, with the Complainant yelling for him to brake.  The Complainant described their vehicle as going over the grass, tires spinning, and then straight into the intersection and over the median.  Furthermore, she described theSOas also going on the grass as he exited the highway, with his sirens on the whole time.  The Scion then spun and struck a pick-up truck, and the airbags deployed and her seatbelt broke from the impact.The Complainant described their car as smoking and, after about 20 seconds, she grabbed some personal items and got out and she andCW#5 then walked away from the car in order to be safe.CW#5 jumped the guard rail to the north of Mayfield Road and theSOstopped his Jeep and turned the emergency siren off, following which he pursuedCW#5 and placed him under arrest.During the course of this investigation, in addition toCW#5 and the Complainant, nineCWs, as well as theSO, were interviewed bySIUinvestigators.  While there were no recordings of the incident, the evidence of the nineCWs, (which substantially differed from that ofCW#5 and the Complainant, but which was consistent with that of theSO), allowed a fairly accurate narrative of what occurred to be extrapolated from the reliable evidence.According to theSO, he was driving in the left westbound lane on Sandalwood Parkway, returning to his police division, when he was passed on the right side by a red Scion, which then cut in front of him causing him to brake and swerve to the right.This evidence appears consistent with that of the Complainant, wherein she said that after her husband had tried unsuccessfully to merge in the left lane, he cut off the Jeep driven by theSO.The Scion was then observed by theSOtravelling at a higher rate of speed than the flow of traffic and swerving in and out of the two westbound lanes as it manoeuvred around other traffic.  TheSOdescribedCW#5’s driving as aggressive, raising concerns that he was possibly impaired.  As a result, theSOactivated his vehicle’s siren and flashing headlights and tried to catch up to the Scion in an effort to obtain either a licence plate number or to identify the driver.  TheSOstated that he was two to three car lengths behind the Scion when he activated his emergency equipment.TheSOthen observedCW#5 to drive onto the Highway 410 northbound ramp and accelerate to a high rate of speed, while theSObecame held up behind other traffic and fell behind.  TheSOobserved the Scion to swerve around other northbound vehicles on Highway 410, as it gained speed and lengthened the distance between his vehicle and the Scion; he estimated his own top speed at approximately 140 km/h, while the Scion continued to pull away from him.  TheSOindicated that when he realized, while still on the 410 Highway, that he could not catch up to the Scion, he discontinued his efforts to catch up to the vehicle, instead turning off his emergency equipment and reducing his speed.  TheSOobserved the Scion then exit Highway 410 at the Mayfield Road exit ramp, but by the time he reached the ramp, he had lost sight of the vehicle.  He described the off ramp at Mayfield Road as an uphill grade which obstructed his view of where the Scion had gone.TheSO’s description of the fashion in which the Scion was being operated, up until this point in time, appears consistent with that of the Complainant, who described her husband as  being in, “a full on race” with the Jeep driven by theSO.  While no civilian witnesses came forward to provide information with respect to the Scion swerving around other traffic on the ramp to Highway 410, the evidence appears consistent with the observations of other civilian witnesses as to the manner by which the Scion swerved around other traffic on the on ramp to Mayfield Road, which is quite similar to the Highway 410 on ramp.  On that basis, I find that the evidence of theSOto this point in time is consistent with the other available evidence and I accept it as accurate.CW#9, who was also driving northbound on Highway 410, observed the red Scion pass him on his left side, and then cut in front of his vehicle.  He placed the speed of the Scion at approximately 170 to 180 km/h and described the car almost striking his car as it cut in front of him.  He further described the Scion then swerving around other northbound vehicles as it continued northbound.  I find that this evidence is fully consistent with theSO’s observations.CW#9 indicated that he only heard the whoop-whoop sound of a siren, as opposed to a continuous wail, as it approached his vehicle from behind some 15 seconds after the red Scion had passed and he did not observe any emergency lights.  Approximately ten seconds later, he again heard a siren and he observed what he described as a blackSUVpassing him, and he associated the siren with that vehicle.  He described thisSUVas travelling at approximately 140 km/h and being driven cautiously, as opposed to in a reckless manner, as he described the manner in which the Scion was being driven.CW#9 estimated the distance, between the red Scion and the blackSUVwith the siren, as being some one to two kilometres and he opined that theSUVwas following, rather than chasing, the Scion.  He further indicated that he believed that the siren was only activated as theSUVpassed him, as a method of alerting him that it was approaching.WhileCW#9 had intended to exit at the Mayfield Road exit, he noted that, before he or theSO’s vehicle, which was travelling in front of him, could enter onto the ramp, there was a large cloud of dust ahead at the intersection of Mayfield Road and the Highway 410 off ramp.CW#6, who was stopped in the right turn lane waiting to turn right onto Mayfield Road from the off ramp from Highway 410, was two vehicles back from a Subaru, which was the first car at the intersection, and a pick-up truck which was directly in front of him.CW#6 was waiting for the traffic signal to turn from red to green, when he observed a red Scion pass him on the right shoulder, at a speed that he placed in excess of 100 km/h.CW#6 observed the Scion to strike the curb, causing it to tip onto its left side wheels, with the right side wheels coming off the ground, at which point he lost sight of the vehicle.CW#6 estimated that the Jeep driven by theSOdid not arrive until some 30 to 60 seconds after the red Scion had passed him on the shoulder.CW#6 indicated that at the time of theSO’s arrival, while theSOdid not have his siren going continuously, he did give short bursts of the siren in order to signal the cars at the intersection of his approach.CW#6 stated that he had not heard any siren as the Jeep came up the ramp to the intersection, and only heard the short blasts from the Jeep as it came upon the cars stopped at the intersection; he did not see any emergency lighting activated on the Jeep.CW#7, who was in the vehicle withCW#6, observed the red Scion suddenly swerve behind them, onto the right shoulder, at speeds in excess of 100 km/h, and then go straight into the intersection and strike the Toyota.  She estimated that theSOonly arrived at the intersection between 30 seconds and one minute after the collision and she did not hear any sirens until the Jeep arrived at the scene.CW#10 was driving his Ford pick-up truck and was stopped at the red light behind a black Subaru, which was the lead vehicle stopped at the Highway 410 off ramp intersection.  He observed that the red Scion suddenly appeared on the shoulder to the right of his truck, travelling very fast, causing dirt and dust to be thrown up against his truck.  He placed the speed of the Scion as in excess of 100 km/h and indicated that his truck shook when the Scion passed, so great was its speed.CW#10 observed the Scion enter the intersection, go straight over the median, and strike a Toyota.CW#10 stated that at no time did he see the brake lights from the Scion come on as it passed.CW#10 described theSO’s Jeep as arriving some ten seconds after the collision, after the occupants of the Scion had already exited and run off and the Scion caught fire.CW#10 indicated that he also heard a “whoop-whoop” sound from the Jeep, but did not see any lights, and he described the Jeep as not appearing to pursue the Scion, as it moved through traffic in a calm and controlled manner at a speed of between 20 and 30 km/h.CW#10 opined that the Jeep was responding to the collision, not pursuing the Scion, and that it had no effect on the way in which the Scion was being operated or the subsequent collision.According toCW#1, who was in the black Subaru being driven by his wife,CW#2, and the first vehicle in the line stopped in the curb lane waiting to turn right to travel eastbound on Mayfield Road, the red Scion drove past their vehicle, on the right side shoulder, twice clipping the Subaru on the passenger side as it passed.CW#1 estimated the speed of the Scion at approximately 130 to 140 km/h.CW#1 then observed a Toyota on Mayfield Road heading westbound, waiting to turn left at the intersection, when the Scion drove across the median and collided with the Toyota on the driver’s side, causing all the airbags in the Toyota to deploy.Within seconds following the collision,CW#1 observed the Jeep driven by theSOarrive, without its sirens activated.CW#2 described the red Scion as having “appeared in a flash” as she was waiting for the traffic signal to turn green, and she estimated the speed of the Scion as being approximately 150 km/h as it attempted to pass them on the right side using the paved shoulder.  The Scion clipped the right side of the Subaru, but did not stop, rather entering the intersection and striking a Toyota, which was stopped waiting to make a left turn.CW#3, who was on Mayfield Road and saw the aftermath of the collision, stated that he did not hear a siren until after he had already placed and completed a 911 call, at which time he observed a Jeep, with no emergency lighting activated, approach.CW#11, who was driving behind the Toyota on Mayfield Road approaching the Highway 410 off ramp intersection, observed the red Scion coming from the right turn lane, or from the shoulder to the right of the turn lane, where it drove around other cars, at a high rate of speed, and collided with the Toyota.  Following the collision,CW#11 drove to the location where the two cars had come to rest, stopped there for about ten seconds, and then continued on Mayfield Road and pulled over some 40 metres ahead of the collision.  As he passed the collision,CW#11 observed no emergency lights, nor did he hear any sirens, and it was not until approximately two minutes after he had pulled over that he first saw theSOarrive in his Jeep.  He described the Jeep as not being driven fast and as coming to a controlled stop safely.CW#4, who was the operator of the Toyota, indicated that after the collision it took him some three minutes to exit his vehicle, as his door was jammed and he had to climb into the back seat, where he was able to exit with the assistance of some citizens.CW#4 stated that only after those three minutes, did he first hear the sound of a siren.TheSOindicated that he also exited Highway 410 at the Mayfield Road off ramp, but that he did so at a normal speed arriving at the intersection to see thatCW#5 had already collided with the Toyota, whereupon he turned right onto Mayfield Road and stopped his vehicle.  He then observedCW#5 and the Complainant exit the Scion and run across Mayfield Road and jump over a guard rail and he pursued and arrestedCW#5.  When theSOaskedCW#5 why he ran,CW#5 indicated that he was scared and did not want to go to jail.WO#1, who stayed withCW#5 until the arrival of the ambulance, indicated thatCW#5 told him that a car tried to pull him over and he got scared so he sped away and crashed into the Toyota.Based on all of the evidence, it appears clear thatCW#5 initially attempted to move in front of theSO’s Jeep, which was to his left on Sandalwood Parkway, as he wished to make a left turn ahead.  Whether or not theSOwas aware ofCW#5’s intention is unclear, as it is unclear whether or not theSOactually saw the red Scion attempt to merge in front of him, and whether his closing the gap thereby preventingCW#5 from merging was intentional or because he was simply unaware.  Regardless, based on the evidence ofCW#5 and the Complainant, it is clear thatCW#5 became outraged at his inability to merge in front of theSO’s Jeep and he then gestured at theSObefore cutting him off.  I have no doubt that, at that point,CW#5 was unaware that theSOwas a police officer.WhenCW#5 then observed that theSOwas trying to stop him, by his own evidence, he sped off.  It is clear from the evidence of those who observedCW#5’s driving, thatCW#5 was driving at excessive speeds and that he was weaving in and out of traffic in an aggressive manner.While I find that theSOinitially activated both his emergency lighting system and siren in order to catch up to the red Scion and identify either the driver or the licence plate number of the vehicle, there is no evidence, with the exception of that from the Complainant, that theSOentered into a police pursuit with the Scion after his initial attempts to catch up and stop the vehicle.  On the contrary, several civilian witnesses who observed theSO’s driving described it as calm, controlled, and not at an excessive rate of speed.With respect to the evidence of the Complainant, I find that I am unable to place much reliance on her version of events, as it is materially contradicted by the nine civilian witnesses who either observed theSOdriving on the highway, or observed his arrival at the collision scene.  I have specifically made note of the evidence of the civilian witnesses at the collision scene that theSOonly arrived at the collision scene well after the collision had occurred, with estimates ranging from ten seconds, up to three minutes, after the collision, and that no siren was heard prior to theSO’s arriving at the intersection, when he would intermittently activate his siren for the purpose of notifying and warning other motorists who were ahead of him.  I also note that none of the witnesses, save one[1], saw theSOwith his emergency lighting activated, and find this supports the account of theSOthat he had disengaged his emergency equipment and slowed and fallen back prior to his exiting onto the ramp at Mayfield Road.I have also placed particular emphasis on the evidence ofCW#9, who observed both the Scion and theSO’s vehicle on Highway 410, and placed the police vehicle as travelling some one to two kilometres behind the Scion, and as only activating its siren in order to alert other traffic.  Furthermore,CW#9 described theSOas following, as opposed to pursuing, the Scion, and described his manner of driving as cautious, and not reckless as was his description of the driving of the red Scion.Finally, with respect to the Complainant’s evidence that the Jeep was right on their bumper, or within one car length behind, from the time that theSOfirst attempted to stop their vehicle, until the time of the collision, with her evidence being that theSOdrove up onto the grass behind the Scion, after the Scion lost control, this is clearly contradicted not only by the civilian witnesses, but also by the forensic evidence and the photos as to the location of the vehicles, which had not been moved prior to the arrival ofSIUinvestigators.  As such, I find that I must reject the evidence of the Complainant in its entirety, except with respect to those points which are confirmed by other evidence.Having considered all of the evidence, then, I find that upon observingCW#5’s aggressive driving, including both cutting off his vehicle and weaving in and out of traffic at excessive rates of speed, theSOinitially attempted to catch up to the red Scion to either perform a vehicle stop or to identify the vehicle and driver.  However, when the Scion continued to be driven in a dangerous manner, and at such speeds as prevented theSOfrom safely catching up to the vehicle, he deactivated both his siren and emergency lighting system, only intermittently engaging his siren to alert other drivers of his approach. I further find that theSOhad ceased any attempts of stopping the Scion long before the Scion took the off-ramp to Mayfield Road, passed other vehicles at excessive rates of speed on the right shoulder, entered the intersection against the red light, and collided with the Toyota.I find that this version of events is not only fully supported by the civilian witnesses, but by the Complainant herself, who indicated that they did not exit their motor vehicle for some 20 seconds after the collision, from which I would have expected that, had theSOalready been on scene, he would have approached to arrestCW#5, and not waited until he had run off and jumped the guard rail into the wooded area.On all of the evidence, it is clear that theSOhad reasonable grounds to initially attempt to stop and investigate the red Scion as a result of its excessive speed and manner of driving, and he was acting lawfully when he initially activated his emergency equipment and tried to either stop or identify the driver or vehicle.Thereafter, based on the evidence of all of the civilian witnesses, and consistent with the evidence of theSO, I find that he abandoned any attempt to either perform a vehicle stop or to catch up to the subject vehicle, in favour of public safety, and simply followed at a lesser speed and with calm and caution.The question to be determined then, is whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence, specifically, whether or not his driving rose to the level of being dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249(1) of theCriminal Code, and did thereby cause bodily harm, contrary to s.249(3).Pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, s.249 requires that the driving be “dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place” and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances”.In considering the test for dangerous driving, I note that it is not disputed, as confirmed by the scene photos, that at the time of this incident the weather was clear and dry and visibility was good. While the evidence was that traffic was between moderate and heavy, it being approximately 6:24 pm on a Saturday, there is no evidence that theSO’s driving at any time interfered with any other traffic and, while he momentarily accelerated to try and perform a vehicle stop, the evidence appears to confirm that his vehicle only travelled at a high speed for a brief matter of seconds, and that his speeds, while in excess of the speed limit, were not excessively so.On the evidence of the civilian witnesses, I find thatCW#5 was driving at a far greater speed than was theSOand that he lost control of his vehicle, resulting in a single vehicle collision, not because of the actions of theSO, but because of his own voluntary decision to try to outrun police and, in doing so, fleeing at an extreme rate of speed with no regard for other people using the highway, ultimately causing the collision which resulted in his passenger’s injuries.  As such, I find that there is no nexus between the driving of theSOand the collision and subsequent injuries sustained therein.Having fully considered the evidence in this matter, as well as the law as set down by the Supreme Court of Canada as to the factors to consider in assessing whether or not I have reasonable grounds to believe that there is sufficient evidence to make out a charge of dangerous driving on the part of theSO, I do not find that it is made out on this record.  Taking into account that the only evidence that I have which would support a charge of dangerous driving would be that of a high rate of speed, countered by the evidence that the officer was only driving at that high rate of speed for an extremely short period of time and distance, following which he chose to abandon his efforts to stop, and/or identify, the motor vehicle in favour of public safety, I find that the evidence is not sufficient to satisfy me that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the actions of theSOamounted to a ‘marked departure’ of the standard of care of a reasonable person in these circumstances. As indicated earlier, I also find that there is no nexus between the driving of theSOand the injuries sustained by the Complainant.In conclusion, as the evidence does not satisfy me that theSO’s actions fell outside of the limits of the criminal law, no charges will issue.Date:	March 4, 2019Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=256

Witnesses described this altercation differently, although at some point it became clear that the Complainant had a handgun.[1]The Complainant exited the pub and walked towards the rear parking lot, invitingCW#2 to take things outside as he left.After the Complainant left the pub,WO#4 called 911 to report that the Complainant was in possession of a black semi-automatic handgun. The call occurred at 12:00:11 a.m. on June 7, 2018, andWO#4 provided the Complainant’s description. It was not known at the time whether the Complainant had left the area, andWO#4 was unable to provide a description of his vehicle or his direction of travel.At approximately 12:01 a.m., the dispatcher broadcasted the information from the 911 call. TPS officersSO#1,SO#2,WO#2,WO#3,WO#5 andWO#6 responded.SO#1 andWO#2 were partners that night and shared a marked police vehicle. They arrived at the parking lot behind the Muckish Irish Pub at approximately 12:06 a.m. They drove part way into the parking lot and exited their vehicle.WO#3 andSO#2 were in a markedSUVpolice vehicle and parked behind them.WO#5 andWO#6 were still en route when the shooting occurred.TheICCSwas activated onSO#1 andWO#2’s police vehicle and its footage showed a line of vehicles parked on the east side of the parking lot. A white Mercedes was the first vehicle in the line and partly obscured from the camera’s field of view as the police vehicle drove into the parking lot.WO#4 andCW#6 were standing near the west side of the parking lot, near the rear door of the Muckish Irish Pub.WO#4 approached the TPS officers and said “that’s him.”  At this moment,WO#4 recognized the Complainant sitting in the driver’s seat of the white Mercedes and motioned the officers to the vehicle. The interaction that followed occurred primarily off camera.[2]SO#1 andWO#2 approached the white Mercedes along withSO#2 andWO#3.SO#1 andSO#2 were equipped with Glock handguns, although it is unclear when they drew their firearms.WO#2, who was equipped with a C8 rifle, pointed his firearm at the Complainant. The Complainant reportedly looked away from the officers and towards his centre console. The officers reportedly told the Complainant to get out of the car and to show them their hands. The Complainant did not comply and rolled the driver’s side window up.WO#2 stepped to the left, in front of the vehicle, to get cover andSO#1 approached the driver’s side door with his service pistol in his hands.SO#2 stood next toSO#1 near the front driver’s side bumper.SO#1 reached to open the door and was surprised to find that it was unlocked.At this moment, bothSO#1 andWO#2 reported observing the Complainant with a handgun.SO#1 said the gun was pointed at him and he felt that his life was in danger. A single “pop” was heard andSO#1 felt what he described as a “torpedo” hitting his chest.SO#1 also discharged his firearm towards the Complainant but he was unsure who fired first. He described shooting the Complainant as a reaction to seeing the gun pointed at him.SO#1 was also unsure how many times he fired, although the physical evidence suggests he shot his gun three times but that the last bullet jammed.[3]WO#2 recalled seeing the Complainant shootSO#1. He described hearing a single shot, seeing the Mercedes’ driver’s window shatter and seeingSO#1 bend over and grab his upper left chest.WO#2 immediately trained the red light of his C8 rifle on the Complainant’s face and took one shot from a distance of about two feet.[4]As he did thisSO#2, who stood to his right, also unleashed a volley of shots towards the Complainant.[5]WO#3 was standing about 30 feet away and witnessed the altercation. He saw the Complainant rolling down his window and heard someone shout “gun” followed by several gunshots.SO#1 took a couple of steps back and appeared to be shot.WO#3 did not discharge his firearm because there were other officers in front of him.The shooting was also witnessed by aCWand several other witnesses also heard the shooting.WO#4 was in the parking lot, walking back to the pub, when he heard “lots of gunfire” coming from multiple weapons. He said the shots occurred over a five second interval. At first he heard one shot and then multiple shots – the first shot sounded different.[6]The sound of gunfire was recorded on the police radio communications which captured the sound of ten gunshots between 12:06:19 a.m. and 12:06:33 a.m. – a 14 second period.[7]It was quickly broadcasted that shots had been fired, that there should be a rush on an ambulance, that one police officer was shot and that one person was shot inside a vehicle.After the shooting,SO#1 moved back in shock. He repeated aloud that he had been shot and looked down but could not see any blood. He noticed that a bullet was jammed in his service firearm.The Complainant had slumped over, face down, in the front passenger seat of the vehicle. His clothing and face were bloody and a handgun was still underneath his left torso.WO#1, a sergeant, was near the Muckish Irish Pub when he heard the exchange of gunfire. He drove to the scene and ran to the parking lot with his service pistol drawn. When he arrivedSO#1 was still near the front driver’s corner of the white Mercedes and told him that he had been shot but that he was okay.WO#1 instructedSO#1 to move away from the scene.WO#5 andWO#6 also arrived on scene and assisted with removing the Complainant from the vehicle.WO#6 entered the rear driver’s side of the Mercedes,WO#5 went into the front driver’s side andWO#3 went into the front passenger side.WO#2 approached the passenger door and reported seeing the Complainant take three shallow breaths. He kept his C8 trained on him.WO#1 also approached the vehicle with his conducted energy weapon drawn.WO#2 saw the muzzle of a firearm protruding from under the Complainant’s left chest andWO#3 removed the firearm.WO#2 said thatWO#3 set the firearm on the pavement next to the vehicle, butWO#6 said thatWO#3 placed the firearm on the floorboard of the passenger’s side of the Mercedes.The Complainant was handcuffed and his body was moved out of the driver’s side door and placed onto the ground. His clothing was cut from his body and a black firearm holster fell from his waistband.SO#2 andWO#3 started chest compressions.WO#2 noticed that there were civilians in the parking lot and picked up the Complainant’s firearm with his ungloved hands. He went to the front of his police vehicle and removed the magazine in front of theICCS. He said he was not detailed to clear the Glock and he picked up the gun in the heat of the moment; however,WO#1 indicated to theSIUthat he orderedWO#2 to seize the firearm and prove it safe. In any event,WO#2 reportedly placed the firearm, its magazine and a spent shell into an evidence bag which he secured in the trunk of his cruiser.TheEMSeventually arrived and transported the Complainant to the Scarborough General Hospital (SGH) where he was pronounced dead. A post mortem examination was performed on his body on June 8, 2018, and the cause of death was found to be multiple gunshot wounds. It is unknown ifSO#1 orSO#2, or both, ultimately shot the bullets responsible for the Complainant’s death.SO#1’s ballistic vest was seized by theSIUand a projectile was recovered from the left chest area of the vest. The bullet had piercedSO#1s memo book and shattered the glass on his cellphone which he kept in his left chest pocket.SO#1’s skin was not pierced by the bullet but he reportedly had a red mark close to his heart.TheSIUalso examined the white Mercedes and noted that there were projectiles, cartridge cases and large amounts of money in the front passenger seat area. There was a purse on the seat that contained two fully loaded Glock 9mm magazines. Two large capacity magazines, capable of holding 50 bullets, were also found in the vehicle.The question that must be asked in these circumstances is whetherSO#1 andSO#2 were acting lawfully when they discharged their firearms at the Complainant, resulting in his death. In my opinion, their use of force falls clearly within the scope of force that police officers are permitted to use by ss. 25(1) and (3) of theCriminal Code.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Codeof Canada, a police officer is, if he or she acts on reasonable grounds, justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Further, pursuant to subsection 3:(3)  Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.As such, in order forSO#1 andSO#2 to qualify for protection from prosecution under section 25, it must be established that they were in the execution of their lawful duties, that they was acting on reasonable grounds, and that they used no more force than was necessary to effect their duty.  Furthermore, because the officers used force likely to cause death or grievous bodily injury when they shot the Complainant, subsection 3 imposes the additional requirement that they believe on reasonable grounds that this level of force was necessary in order to preserve themselves or another person from death or grievous bodily harm.It is clear thatSO#1 andSO#2 were acting in accordance with a lawful duty when they responded to a 911 call reporting that the Complainant was in possession of a handgun. The officers had reasonable grounds to believe the Complainant was in possession of a firearm contrary to s. 91(1) of theCriminal Codeand could arrest him pursuant to s. 495(1) of theCriminal Code. The officers were also acting in accordance with their common law duty to protect life (seeR. v. Godoy, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311) by investigating the call related to a firearm and attempting to arrest the Complainant, who was identified as the suspect byWO#4.With respect to the other requirements pursuant to sections 25(1) and (3), I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR v Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]The court describes the test required under s.25 as follows:Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances. That is not the end of the matter. Section 25(3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force, i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily harm. The officer's belief must be objectively reasonable. This means that the use of force under s. 25(3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis (Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).The decision of Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice inChartier v Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada above, sets out other relevant provisions of theCriminal Codeto be considered, as follows:27. 	Use of force to prevent commission of offence - Everyone is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary(a)	to prevent the commission of an offence(i) for which, if it were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and(ii) that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone, or(b)	to prevent anything being done that, on reasonable grounds, he believes would, if it were done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).This Section, therefore, authorizes the use of force to prevent the commission of certain offenses. “Everyone"" would include a police officer. The force must not be more than that which is reasonably necessary. Therefore, an objective test is called for. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Scopelliti (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 held that the use of deadly force can be justified only in either cases of self-defence or in preventing the commission of a crime likely to cause immediate and serious injury.Further, the court sets out a number of other legal principles gleaned from the legal precedents cited, including the following:(a)	Whichever section of theCriminal Codeis used to assess the actions of the police, the Court must consider the level of force that was necessary in light of the circumstances surrounding the event.(b)	""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". The same applies to the use of force in making an arrest or preventing an escape. Like the driver of a vehicle facing a sudden emergency, the policeman ""cannot be held to a standard of conduct which one sitting in the calmness of a court room later might determine was the best course."" (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).(c)	Police officers perform an essential function in sometimes difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. The police must not be unduly hampered in the performance of that duty. They must frequently act hurriedly and react to sudden emergencies. Their actions must therefore be considered in the light of the circumstances.(d)	""It is both unreasonable and unrealistic to impose an obligation on the police to employ only the least amount of force which might successfully achieve their objective. To do so would result in unnecessary danger to themselves and others. They are justified and exempt from liability in these situations if they use no more force than is necessary, having regard to their reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers in which they find themselves"" (Levesque v. Zanibbi et al.).On the basis of the foregoing principles of law, I must accordingly determine whether:(1)SO#1 andSO#2 believed that it was necessary to discharge their firearms because they were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant; and(2)	Whether their subjective belief was objectively reasonable, or, in other words, whether their actions would be considered reasonable by an objective bystander who had all of the information available to them at the time that they discharged their firearms.On the evidence before me, I have no hesitation finding thatSO#1 andSO#2 believed the use of lethal force was necessary because they were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm.SO#1 said that he felt his life was in jeopardy when he saw the Complainant point a handgun at him.SO#2 did not provide theSIUwith a statement which, in other circumstances, might make it challenging to assess his subjective belief in the risk of harm. However,WO#2 was standing next toSO#2 and said he saw what appeared to be a firearm in the Complainant’s hands, heard the sound of a gunshot and sawSO#1 react as if he had been shot. I conclude that these circumstances were also apparent toSO#2 and that the only reasonable inference is that he subjectively perceived a risk of death or grievous bodily harm toSO#1, himself and others present at the scene.I can also readily conclude that it was objectively reasonable for the officers’ to believe that shooting the Complainant was necessary because they were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm. The TPS officers were aware that they were responding to a 911 call reporting that the Complainant was in possession of a firearm. They were directed to the Complainant who was in the Mercedes and commanded him to exit the vehicle, but he ignored them. When the Complainant was confronted bySO#1, the evidence establishes that he produced a firearm and pointed it at him.SO#1 does not know if he or the Complainant fired the first bullet, although a witness said that the Complainant fired the first bullet andWO#2 andWO#4 said the first bullet sounded different than the gunfire that followed. Regardless of whether the Complainant orSO#1 fired the first shot, I am satisfied that an objective bystander would believe the officers shooting the Complainant was justified in these circumstances. The Complainant pointed a firearm atSO#1, creating a real risk of immediate and significant harm (including death) toSO#1. The officers were entitled to act accordingly to protect themselves. I also note that, although the police officers shot upwards of twenty times, all the evidence establishes that this shooting occurred over the course of seconds and that during this period the Complainant was also shooting his gun.[8]In these circumstances, the police officers returning fire until they were satisfied that the Complainant was no longer a threat was absolutely necessary, proportional and justifiable.In summary, I am unable to find that I have reasonable grounds to believe that eitherSO#1 orSO#2 committed a criminal offence in relation to the Complainant’s death. It is clear that the Complainant produced a firearm and shotSO#1. Irrespective of who shot first, the Complainant presented a grave risk toSO#1 when he pointed a firearm at him. As such, the officers shooting at the Complainant to neutralize that threat falls clearly within the scope of force permitted by law. Thus, no charges will issue and the case will be closed.Date:	March 28, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=286
,,Baldwin,Ontario,n r\n The following is clear from the information gathered by the SIU which included statements from the Complainant the CW the driver of the fleeing van SO 3 and a host of witness officers police communication recordings and GPS data associated with the police cruisers As was their legal right neither SO 1 nor SO 2 provided statements to the SIU At about 10:30 p.m DRPS officers were dispatched to the Real Canadian Superstore at Brock Street North and Taunton Road East Whitby in relation to a theft of merchandise The CW and a couple of associates were the suspects in the theft The CW entered a van in the parking lot and proceeded south along Brock Street North followed by SO 1 and his partner WO 1 They travelled down the roadway and followed as the CW turned left onto Rossland Road The officers were soon joined by other police cruisers who took up positions around the van The convoy of vehicles proceeded east toward Oshawa Though their speeds were fairly moderate on Rossland Road the CW disregarded red traffic control signals at a number of intersections and entered the westbound lanes of travel on occasion At a point east of Garrard Street it was decided that the officers would attempt to stop the van by performing a “rolling block” The maneuver entails the positioning of cruisers around the target vehicle with the intention of ultimately bringing it to a standstill On the first such occasion the CW was able to elude the cruisers by driving south into the parking lot of a townhouse complex in the area of 899 Rossland Road and thereafter re-emerging and continuing east on Rossland Road On the second occasion with SO 1’s cruiser behind the van SO 2’s in front of the CW and SO 3 driving alongside the driver’s side of the van the CW steered northward and sideswiped SO 3’s cruiser SO 3’s cruiser was struck a second time by the van as the CW drove across the south sidewalk and made contact with two parked vehicles in a private driveway at 655 Christie Avenue before returning to the roadway It was around this time that the Complainant was traveling east along Rossland Road in her Chevrolet Malibu She stopped her vehicle and pulled to the south curb As the Complainant did so the van struck the rear driver’s side of her vehicle before passing it on the driver’s side The van continued east a short distance and collided head on with WO 9’s cruiser in and around the area of the Rossland Road and Hortop Street intersection The van came to a stop in the west lanes of Rossland Road at Carnegie Avenue where it was surrounded by several DRPS cruisers The time was about 10:45 p.m The CW was extricated from the vehicle and placed under arrest.\n,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=375
,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Johnson,Ontario,She had blood on her face and an obvious injury to her leg,"It is clear that no force was used on the Complainant during the course of her arrest and the only offence to consider in these circumstances is criminal negligence causing bodily harm contrary to s. 221 of theCriminal Code. Criminal negligence is a high threshold. It is defined by s. 219(1) of theCriminal Codewhich states that “[e]very one is criminally negligent who, in doing anything, or in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do, shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.” The Court of Appeal for Ontario in R. v. Sharp (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 428 (Ont. C.A.) further clarified that criminal negligence does not require proof of intention or deliberation. Indifference is sufficient to make out criminal negligence if the conduct amounted to a marked and substantial departure from the standard of a reasonable person and the person “either recognized and ran an obvious and serious risk to the lives and safety of others or, alternatively, gave no thought to that risk.”In this case, there is no evidence that the subject officers’ conduct meets the high threshold required to make out criminal negligence. Police officers are authorized to apprehend those they may lawfully take into custody, andSO#1 andSO#2 had seen the Complainant about to enter a stolen vehicle and were within their rights in attempting to arrest her. Similarly, I can find no fault in the officers engaging her in a short foot pursuit even if it was towards Weber Street. Weber Street has a modest speed limit (50 km/h) and a sidewalk and, as a result, I do not believe chasing the Complainant in that direction posed an obvious risk to her life or safety. This is not a situation where the officers were funneling the Complainant to an area where she had no choice but to enter the roadway if she wanted to flee. In fact, the evidence indicates they were some distance behind her when she chose to enter Weber Street.  On this record, it is clear that the Complainant entered the roadway and then jumped into the trailer on her own accord. As such, I am unable to find this conduct is a departure from the standard of a reasonable person (let alone a marked and substantial departure). Nor do I believe the subject officers’ conduct demonstrated a wanton or reckless disregard to the Complainant’s life or safety. I am therefore unable to form reasonable grounds to believeSO#1 orSO#2 committed a criminal offence in relation to the Complainant’s injuries, and the file will be closed.Date:	May 31, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=348

,London Police Service,London,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant was seen at hospital and treated for a lacerated liver,"The offence that arises for consideration in this case is that of dangerous driving contrary to then section 249 (recently amended to s. 320.13) of theCriminal Code.  The offence is predicated on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  On a review of all of the evidence, I am satisfied that the manner in which theSOandWO#1 operated their police vehicles fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law. The officers were within their rights under the regulation governing police pursuits in the province – O. Reg. 266/10 – to initiate a pursuit in this case.  They had received information that the Complainant had just committed a violent criminal offence in stealing the Subaru, and they had good cause to believe that the Complainant posed a continuing threat to public safety. While each officer reached a top speed in the area of 85 km/h, it appears this occurred over a short period of time early in their engagement with the Complainant as they attempted to catch up to the stolen Subaru.  Thereafter, theGPSdata downloaded from the officers’ vehicles indicate that they travelled within a range of 40-60 km/h throughout the pursuit.  Thus, while any pursuit necessarily entails some level of risk to its participants and third parties in its vicinity, the officers’ speeds did not appreciably contribute to that risk, especially in light of the favourable road (dry), traffic (minimal) and visibility (good) conditions.  The officers’ regard for public safety was also manifest in the fact that they activated their emergency equipment during the pursuit and broadcast information about the pursuit as it unfolded, the latter facilitating the efforts of a senior officer to monitor what was happening.  Finally, the Complainant was not in my view unduly pushed by the officers nor prevented by their efforts from operating his vehicle in a safe fashion despite the police vehicles being within one or two car lengths from the Subaru at points during the pursuit, a fact demonstrated by the space the officers left for the Subaru’s egress from the school parking lot. On this record, in the context of a pursuit that transpired over no more than a kilometre and a half and one to two minutes, I am satisfied that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the officers either caused or contributed to the collision in question, or otherwise drove dangerously in violation of theCriminal Code.Date:	April 24, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=302

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,nCause of Death On May 29 2018 a forensic pathologist conducted a post-mortem examination of the body of the Complainant and determined that the immediate cause of death was multiple trauma consistent with descent from a great height,"The dispatcher immediately dispatched two cruisers, with theSOandWO#2 in one, andWO#1 in the other, while the call taker continued to speak withCW#3, who described the man on the roof as taking off his backpack and setting it on the roof, then walking away from the edge before returning and looking down to the ground below.  Finally, the caller described the man as sitting on the ledge with his back to the street.TheSOandWO#2 were the first to arrive at the building, at 3:47:09 p.m., only 11 minutes and four seconds after first being notified by the dispatcher.  These two officers proceeded to the rooftop, where they gained access by way of an unlocked door.  Upon entering onto the rooftop, they immediately observed the Complainant seated on the ledge near the northwest edge of the building.  Both officers then attempted to engage the Complainant in conversation, as didWO#1, when he arrived three to four minutes later.The officers introduced themselves to the Complainant and continually offered him assistance.  They assured him that they were only there to help, and tried to dissuade him from jumping.  The Complainant, who was mumbling to himself and holding his head in his hands, at no time directly responded to the officers, but appeared to be speaking to himself.Each of the officers was positioned on a wooden pathway which was enclosed by a railing and which surrounded the access doors to the roof, and each was approximately 15 feet from the Complainant.  When, at one point,WO#2 attempted to move closer to the Complainant by crossing beyond the railing of the wooden pathway, the Complainant appeared to become more distressed, soWO#2 again retreated to position herself inside of the railing in order not to escalate the situation and possibly inadvertently influence the Complainant to jump.While the uniformed officers were the first to arrive at the building, the TPS acted quickly to also ensure that the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) were notified and an ambulance and the Emergency Task Force (ETF) were dispatched, a supervisor was notified, additional police cruisers were dispatched, and arrangements were made for a command post to be set up in the area.When the Complainant began to move backwards towards the edge of the roof, theSOtold him that it was not worth it and that he should allow the police officers to help him.  It was the intention of theSOto convince the Complainant to move away from the edge and to be taken to hospital, when the Complainant suddenly and deliberately leaned backwards and fell off the roof of the building to the paved driveway below.  At the last second, as he was going over the edge, the Complainant appeared to momentarily hold onto the ledge with his legs and he reached up and grabbed the side of the wall for about two seconds, as if to stop himself falling, when he lost his grip and fully fell backwards.  The Complainant did not say anything, and made no noise, as he let go of the ledge and fell to his death below.When theSOmoved to look over the edge of the roof to the ground below, he saw the Complainant lying on the pavement, with two police officers performingCPRon him.TheSOestimated that he was on the roof for approximately ten minutes attempting to communicate with the Complainant, before he jumped, and at no time did any police officer advance towards the Complainant.This evidence is confirmed by theCADreport and the communications recording, wherein it is noted that theSOandWO#2 first set eyes on the Complainant at 3:53:38 p.m., they were speaking with the Complainant at 3:58:08 p.m., and it was reported at 4:06:54 p.m., that the Complainant had jumped.A Report of Post-Mortem (PM) Examination, received by theSIUon March 4, 2019, determined that the cause of death was multiple trauma consistent with a descent from great height.  The toxicology report, received as part of thePMreport, indicated that there were no drugs or alcohol in the Complainant’s blood at the time of his fall.On all of the evidence, it is clear that the Complainant was struggling with some issues which he found were insurmountable and he apparently came to the conclusion that his only recourse was to end his life. While it is unclear what exactly led the Complainant to the brink and caused him to resort to the drastic decision to end his own life, it is clear that he had made that decision on his own.  The police officers who attended and tried to save the Complainant’s life, despite his wishes to the contrary, did all they could to try to save that life in the very short time available to them, before the Complainant took that last fatal step.While the police officer who primarily attempted to communicate with the Complainant was designated as the subject officer, it is clear that all of the officers present acted together in order to attempt to save the life of the Complainant.On these facts, the only charge even remotely relevant for consideration would be that of criminal negligence causing death, contrary to sections 219 and 220 of theCriminal Code.    In order to find reasonable grounds to believe that theSO, or either ofWO#2 orWO#1, committed the offence of Criminal Negligence Causing Death, one must first have reasonable grounds to believe that they had a duty toward the Complainant which they omitted to carry out, and that omission, pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. J.F.(2008), 3 S.C.R. 215, represented ‘amarked and substantial departurefrom the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in circumstances’ where they ‘either recognized and ran an obvious and serious risk to the life’ of the Complainant ‘or, alternatively, gave no thought to that risk’.It is clear on the evidence that all of the police officers present fully appreciated the risk to the life of the Complainant, should he be allowed to carry out his intention of jumping from the rooftop.  Each of the three officers made every effort to attempt to build a rapport with the Complainant and to convince him to move away from the ledge and to abandon his intentions.  Rather than a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances, each of these officers acted more than reasonably and prudently to save the Complainant’s life, despite the tragic outcome.Additionally, immediately following the call fromCW#3, the TPS acted quickly and efficiently to ensure that all necessary services were notified and present on scene to either rescue the Complainant, or to provide assistance should he succeed in jumping. It is clear from the coordinated response of the TPS, that they were taking the threat to the Complainant’s life extremely seriously and that they responded appropriately and with all due speed in order to prevent this tragic death.On all of the evidence, it is clear that the Complainant took his own life despite the attempted intervention by police.  It is further evident that the Complainant, while constantly perched on the edge of the rooftop of the seven storey building, left police with no options to which they could resort to attempt to safely bring him down, other than to try and convince him to abandon his plan.  TheSOfollowed all procedures as set out in the TPS policy guidelines and did all he could to assist the Complainant, and he cannot be held responsible for the Complainant’s actions in fulfilling his intention to end his own life.  On all of the evidence, it is obvious that all three officers present attempted to engage the Complainant with both calm and compassion, and that they never abandoned their attempts to save his life, until he jumped from the building, when other officers immediately moved in to perform life-saving procedures.On these facts, I find that the evidence fails to satisfy me either that the conduct of any responding police officer represented ‘a marked and substantial departure’ from that of a reasonably prudent person in these circumstances, or that there is any causal connection between the actions of the officers present and the tragic death of the Complainant.  As such, there are no grounds here, reasonable or otherwise, for the consideration of criminal charges and even less so for the laying of same.Original signed by				Date:	March 21, 2019Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=263
,London Police Service,London,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment On May 25 2018 while at the hospital the Complainant had X-ray and Computerized Tomography CT scans performed and was diagnosed with a number of injuries including multiple arm and hand fractures the loss of his right index finger and a lacerated liver,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to section 249(3) of theCriminal Code(presently, section 320.13(2)).  The offence is predicated in part on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances: R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 SCR 49.  TheSOcannot be said to have caused or contributed to the Complainant’s loss of control of the motorcycle that resulted in its collision with the fence.  Aside from serving as the impetus for the Complainant’s flight down Brydges Street, the officer had quickly lost sight of the motorcycle and was nowhere near it when the crash occurred.  It was the Complainant’s conduct, and most emphatically his speed, that was solely to blame for the collision.  Aside from that, the evidence shows that theSOmade judicious use of his emergency equipment as he endeavoured to navigate traffic around him, did nothing to imperil motorists and pedestrians in the area, and operated his cruiser at reasonable speeds throughout - never exceeding 60 km/h on Brydges Street, which is governed by a 50 km/h speed limit.  On this record, it is apparent that theSOconducted himself at all times within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law and there is therefore no basis upon which to proceed with criminal charges in this case.

,Guelph Police Service,Brant,Ontario,The Complainant sustained a dislocated right shoulder ,"While there are elements of theSO’s conduct which may have technically run afoul of theHighway Traffic Act, I am satisfied on balance that the manner in which the officer operated his police vehicle fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  I begin by noting that theSOhad clear grounds to believe the Complainant was in possession of a stolen motorcycle and was therefore within his rights to initiate a pursuit.  With respect to the speed at which the officer operated his cruiser, it was observed by four independent civilian witnesses as being far less than that of the motorcycle operated by the Complainant.  While the officer’s speed, which on the evidence appears never to have exceeded 50 km/h, may have violated the limit in the area of a school zone that was traversed, there is no suggestion that it actually endangered anyone in the vicinity.  TheSO’s conduct in relation to his speed is further attenuated by section 128(13)(b) of theHTAwhich, while it does not provide officers carte blanche to exceed the speed limit without regard to public safety considerations, does allow them to speed when in the lawful performance of their duties and it is safe to do so.  It is also evident that the officer failed to come to a stop before proceeding through a stop sign at the intersection of Brant Avenue and Montana Road.  Pursuant to section 136(1)(a) of theHTA, the officer was obliged to come to a complete stop before travelling safely through the intersection, and he ought to have done so.  That said, the civilian witnesses observed him slow and almost stop, or to carry out a ‘rolling stop’, before entering the intersection after ensuring that it was safe to do so.  It is also worth noting that theSOdoes not appear to have put undue pressure on the Complainant in that he was at all times a comfortable distance behind the motorcycle and travelling at a far lesser speed, allowing the Complainant every opportunity to reduce his speed and adopt a safer course.  Indeed, the evidence indicates that theSOdiscontinued the pursuit shortly after he observed the Complainant accelerate through the stop sign at Montana Road.  Finally, theSO’s emergency lighting was on during the brief pursuit.On this record, in the context of theSO’s extremely short-lived engagement in this matter – spanning a mere matter of seconds over no more than about 250 metres during which conditions were dry and visibility good - I have no reasonable grounds to believe that the officer either caused or contributed to the collision in question in any fashion that could attract criminal liability.

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,nCause of Death A forensic pathologist performed a post-mortem examination on the body of the Complainant on May 22 2018 the pathologist determined that the cause of death was due to multiple trauma,"The offence that arises for consideration is criminal negligence causing death contrary to section 220 of theCriminal Code.   As an offence of penal negligence, a simple want of care will not suffice to ground criminal liability; what is required, in part, is conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  It is apparent on the record gathered in theSIU’s investigation that theSO’s conduct fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  In the short time that he dealt with the Complainant, the officer calmly engaged her in conversation, explaining the reasons for the police presence and their concern for her health and safety.  He attempted to have the Complainant open the door, but was repeatedly rebuffed by a person who seemed to be in possession of her faculties and indicating she was fine.  TheSOproperly considered whether he had a lawful basis for forcibly entering the apartment, and concluded that the Complainant’s behaviour coupled with the limited information at their disposal did not give rise to the necessary exigent circumstances.  That said, theSOtook steps to have the superintendent of the building contacted to bring the apartment’s key, but he was not readily available.  Just before the Complainant fell to her death, the officer learned that she had been in touch with friends to say that she would jump if the police entered her apartment.  With that information, theSOwarned the emergency responders outside her door against taking any measure to gain access to the apartment.  Regrettably, at about the same time, despite no such entry having been made, the Complainant scaled her balcony’s railing and leapt to her death.  In all of this, I am satisfied that theSOconducted himself judiciously, and that he neither caused nor contributed to the Complainant’s death in any fashion that could ground criminal sanction.Date:	May 23, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=334
,Brantford Police Service,Brant,Ontario,n r\n The events in question surrounding the injuries suffered by the Complainant are apparent based on the information collected by the SIU,"The offences that have to be considered in this case are those ofcriminal negligence causing bodily harmanddangerous driving causing bodily harm, contrary to sections 221 and 249(3)[2]of theCriminal Code, respectively.  Both offences are predicated in part on conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  The evidence establishes that the Complainant, for reasons relating to his inebriation and/or mental health issues at the time, intentionally lay down in front of theSO’sSUVin the darkness and did not make the officer aware of his presence.  It is further clear that theSO, after concluding his business at the scene of another incident, entered his policeSUVcompletely unaware of the Complainant’s precarious position and set the vehicle in motion, resulting in the Complainant’s injuries.  Once the officer became aware of what had occurred, he acted immediately to render assistance to the Complainant by stopping and turning off his motor vehicle, checking under his vehicle with a flashlight to assess the Complainant’s condition, notifying nearby paramedics that the Complainant required assistance, and calling the dispatcher, who called for the fire department and a tow truck to lift the vehicle off of the Complainant.  The question arises whether the officer could have acted in some way to avert the injuries that were caused to the Complainant.  Theoretically, theSOmight have personally inspected the front of his vehicle before setting it in motion.  However, I note that the officer had no reason at the time to suspect that someone might take the sort of unusual and drastic action adopted by the Complainant.  On this record, I am satisfied that the level of care exercised by theSOfell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and that there are therefore no reasonable grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	April 18, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=298

TheSIUalso received theNRPS’s communication recordings and DMH’sCCTV. This evidence was almost entirely consistent and clearly established that theSO’s use of force was not excessive in the circumstances. Thus, for the following reasons, I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe theSOcommitted a criminal offence in relation to this incident.On May 18, 2018, the Complainant called for theEMSto take him to the hospital. The Complainant had been living in the woods and, on the day of the incident, his mental health had deteriorated and he was hearing voices.DMH’sCCTVcaptured the Complainant wandering around the hallway from 5:59 p.m. to 7:55 p.m. At 7:07 p.m., he appeared to be fiddling with a knife and looked intoCW#1’s room. At 7:39 p.m., the Complainant spoke with civilian witness (CW) #8 in the hallway for approximately ten minutes.CW#8 later told a 911 dispatcher that she knew the Complainant from school. He told her that he had mental health issues and she recommended a program in Hamilton to him. The Complainant reportedly said something akin to nothing will matter beyond today.CW#8 asked him what he meant and he replied, “Well I am not going to kill myself.” At 7:48 p.m.,CW#8 ended her conversation with the Complainant and was directed to a room by medical staff. At 7:55 p.m., the Complainant enteredCW#1’s room.It is not disputed that once he entered his room the Complainant stabbedCW#1. The stabbing was reportedly seen by multiple witnesses and theCCTVcaptured medical staff fleeing fromCW#1’s room.After the stabbing, four people at DMH called 911 to report that the Complainant had stabbedCW#1 with a knife. Patients in the waiting room were directed to leave the hospital, and theCCTVshowed hospital staff running and locking themselves in rooms. The Complainant leftCW#1 room and began to pace the hallway. He had a knife in his hand, appeared to be yelling and then directed someone out of the hospital. The Complainant continued pacing in the hallways of DMH with a large hunting knife in his right hand with its blade facing down and towards the rear.At 7:56 p.m., theSOwas dispatched to the Urgent Care Centre at DMH. While en route, he learned that the Complainant was armed with a knife and medical staff were hiding from him. TheSOarrived at DMH at the same time as theWOand, before they entered the hospital, they learned that someone at DMH had been stabbed.TheSOand theWOentered the hospital and sawCW#1 lying in the hallway.CW#1 was bleeding significantly from his chest and the officers moved towards him, with theSOin front of theWO. TheCCTVshows that, at 7:58:49 p.m., theSOreached a place where two hallways met and saw the Complainant several feet away with a large hunting knife in his hand. TheSOpointed his firearm at him and yelled, “Police, don’t move.” TheWOmoved into the hallway and the two officers yelled, “Drop the knife. Drop the knife.” TheCCTVclearly captured the Complainant ignoring the officers’ commands and moving in theSO’s direction, taking a few steps before charging towards theSO. The Complainant held a large knife in his right hand, pointed downwards, and swung his arms rapidly as he charged towards theSO. TheSObacked away so he was outside of theCCTVcamera’s field of view and, at 7:58:55 p.m., it appeared as if the Complainant had been shot in the stomach.It is clear that theSOshot the Complainant once in the stomach when the Complainant was about ten feet away from theSO.[2]The Complainant immediately fell to the ground and was no longer visible on theCCTV. TheSOand theWOsaid that, at this point, the Complainant had dropped the knife. The officers commanded the Complainant to get on his stomach on the ground and he complied. TheSOhandcuffed the Complainant with his hands behind his back while theWOprovided cover.[3]When the Complainant was secured, medical staff attended to both the Complainant andCW#1. Ambulances arrived and they were both transported to ECMC for medical treatment.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Codeof Canada, a police officer is, if he or she acts on reasonable grounds, justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Further, pursuant to subsection 3:(3)  Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.As such, in order for theSOto qualify for protection from prosecution under section 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.  Furthermore, because theSOused force likely to cause death or grievous bodily injury when he shot the Complainant, subsection 3 imposes the additional requirement that he believe on reasonable grounds that this force was necessary in order to preserve himself or another person from death or grievous bodily harm.It is clear that theSOwas acting in accordance with a lawful duty when he responded to a 911 call reporting that the Complainant was armed with a knife at a hospital and had stabbed someone. Upon hearing the report, witnessingCW#1 bleeding and observing the Complainant with a knife, theSOclearly had reasonable grounds to arrest the Complainant for, at the very least, assaulting the Complainant with a weapon contrary to section 267(a) of theCriminal Codeand thereby causing him bodily harm (contrary to section 267(b) of theCriminal Code). In addition, theSOwas also acting in accordance with a common law duty to protect life by responding to a call for help and trying to assistCW#1 (seeR. v. Godoy, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 311). I am accordingly satisfied that theSOwas acting in accordance with his lawful duties when he encountered and arrested the Complainant.With respect to the other requirements pursuant to sections 25(1) and (3), I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR v Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]The court describes the test required under s.25 as follows:Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances. That is not the end of the matter. Section 25(3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force, i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily harm. The officer's belief must be objectively reasonable. This means that the use of force under s. 25(3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis (Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).The decision of Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Chartier v Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada above, sets out other relevant provisions of theCriminal Codeto be considered, as follows:27. 	Use of force to prevent commission of offence - Everyone is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary(a)	to prevent the commission of an offence(i) for which, if it were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and(a)	(ii) that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone, or(b)	to prevent anything being done that, on reasonable grounds, he believes would, if it were done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).This Section, therefore, authorizes the use of force to prevent the commission of certain offenses. “Everyone"" would include a police officer. The force must not be more than that which is reasonably necessary. Therefore, an objective test is called for. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Scopelliti (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 held that the use of deadly force can be justified only in either cases of self-defence or in preventing the commission of a crime likely to cause immediate and serious injury.Further, the court sets out a number of other legal principles gleaned from the legal precedents cited, including the following:(a)	Whichever section of theCriminal Codeis used to assess the actions of the police, the Court must consider the level of force that was necessary in light of the circumstances surrounding the event.(b)	""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". The same applies to the use of force in making an arrest or preventing an escape. Like the driver of a vehicle facing a sudden emergency, the policeman ""cannot be held to a standard of conduct which one sitting in the calmness of a court room later might determine was the best course."" (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).(c)	Police officers perform an essential function in sometimes difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. The police must not be unduly hampered in the performance of that duty. They must frequently act hurriedly and react to sudden emergencies. Their actions must therefore be considered in the light of the circumstances.(d)	""It is both unreasonable and unrealistic to impose an obligation on the police to employ only the least amount of force which might successfully achieve their objective. To do so would result in unnecessary danger to themselves and others. They are justified and exempt from liability in these situations if they use no more force than is necessary, having regard to their reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers in which they find themselves"" (Levesque v. Zanibbi et al.).On the basis of the foregoing principles of law, I must accordingly determine whether:(1)	TheSOsubjectively believed that it was necessary to discharge his firearm because he was at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant; and(2)	Whether that belief was objectively reasonable, or, in other words, whether his actions would be considered reasonable by an objective bystander who had all of the information available to theSOat the time that he discharged his firearm.After a consideration of all of the evidence, I have no hesitation in answering yes to both of the above questions. TheSObelieved he was going to die when he saw the Complainant charging at him with a knife and felt he had no other option than to discharge his firearm. This belief was clearly reasonable in the circumstances. The knife was a large hunting-style knife with a wide, five to six inch blade that was capable of inflicting serious bodily harm. TheSOwas aware that the Complainant had just used the knife to stab someone else. It was similarly clear that the Complainant was not going to voluntarily stop charging at theSObecause theSOissued commands for him to stop and drop the weapon, but the Complainant ignored him. TheSOtried to back away from the Complainant, but the Complainant got to within ten feet or less of theSObefore theSOdischarged his firearm.[4]In these circumstances, I am satisfied that any objective bystander in theSO’s situation would believe that his or her life were at risk. I am similarly satisfied that any objective bystander would believe that discharging a firearm was reasonably necessary to stop that risk. Only six seconds elapsed between the moment theSOdiscovered the Complainant in the hallway and the moment theSOshot him. During this very brief time, theSOhad no opportunity to reassess his circumstances and consider if lesser use-of-force options were available to him. Discharging his firearm was the only option theSOhad to reasonably protect himself and was necessary and justified in the circumstances.Having carefully reviewed the relevant law and the record, I am satisfied that theSO’s use of force fell clearly within the limits prescribed by criminal law. TheSOwas at risk of grievous bodily injury or death and it was reasonably necessary for him shoot the Complainant to protect himself. As such, theSO’s actions fell within the protection afforded by section 25 of theCriminal Code.[5]I therefore have no reasonable grounds to believe theSOcommitted a criminal offence and the file will be closed.Date:	March 22, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=282

,Ontario Provincial Police,Brampton,Ontario,Complainant 2 also had a CT scan following which he was diagnosed with a nasal bone fracture a left humerus head where the long bone in the arm connects to the body fracture and a left shoulder dislocation for which he was also referred to a specialist for follow up,"At the time that the vehicle finally came to rest, after the pursuit and subsequent single vehicle collision, the driver, Complainant #1, and his passenger, Complainant #2, were removed from the vehicle and arrested; both were then transported to the hospital where it was discovered that Complainant #1 had sustained a brain bleed, a spinal fracture, bleeding under the sternum, and a lung contusion, while Complainant #2 had sustained a broken nose and a broken bone in his left shoulder, and had dislocated his shoulder.During the course of this investigation, both Complainant #2 and Complainant #1 provided interviews to theSIU, as did five police witnesses.  With respect to the two subject officers,SO#1, who was driving the lead pursuit vehicle during the Suspect Apprehension Pursuit (SAP), declined to be interviewed or to provide her memorandum books notes for review, whileSO#2, the Communications Supervisor who was monitoring theSAP, provided his notes but declined to be interviewed; as subject officers, this was within their legal rights.Due to the time of day when this incident occurred, being at 1:47 a.m., and the fact that the incident began at the ramp to Highway 410 and concluded at the dead end of Kipling Avenue, not surprisingly, an appeal for civilian witnesses garnered no results and none came forward to provide statements.SIUinvestigators also reviewed the memo book notes of all witness officers, theGPS/MPSdata from the two involved police cruisers, the police radio transmissions leading up to and throughout the pursuit, theCDRdata from the vehicle driven by Complainant #1, and variousCCTVfootage from premises along the pursuit route.  With the exception as to how many persons were inside the Traverse during the pursuit, and whether or not Complainant #1 initially stopped his motor vehicle at theRIDEprogram, there is very little disagreement between the statements of the occupants of the Traverse and the officers who were involved in the pursuit, or who monitored the pursuit.  The following narrative is based on the credible and reliable evidence obtained during the investigation.At approximately 1:47 a.m., Complainant #1 was operating a TraverseSUVeastbound on Queen Street East in the City of Brampton and entered onto the ramp to southbound Hwy 410, when he saw aRIDEcheck on the ramp; Complainant #2 was seated in the motor vehicle.  While both Complainant #1 and Complainant #2 claim that a third party was also inside the motor vehicle at the time, since it is not alleged by anyone that this third party was the driver, for my purposes, nothing really turns on this discrepancy.The weather was clear, there was overhead lighting at the point where the stop check was located, and traffic was light.As Complainant #1 came down the ramp to the highway, he slowed and appeared to hesitate, but did not come to a full stop.  While Complainant #1 claims that he initially stopped the car at theRIDEcheck, and spoke to the police officers, based on the evidence of Complainant #2, who confirms the evidence of the four police officers, I find that Complainant #1 slowed, but at no time did he fully stop his motor vehicle, when directed by the officers to do so.Complainant #1 was observed to make eye contact with the officers and appeared to be very aware of their presence.  All four police officers approached the Traverse.Three of the police officers approached the driver’s door, withWO#1 standing to their left.  Complainant #1, who was on a court ordered release not to be outside of his residence at that time, decided to evade the stop check and accelerated away from the police officers. While standing near the rear of the Traverse, when the vehicle did not stop,WO#1 then struck the rear window with his flashlight, before stepping back and observing the Traverse continue and speed up.  Despite Complainant #1’s denial, I accept the evidence of the four police officers, as confirmed by the injury toSO#1, and the communications recording, that in accelerating away from the attempted stop point, the Traverse struckSO#1.At that point, all four officers ran to their respective vehicles, withSO#1 entering the driver’s seat of the black policeSUVwith the subdued markings, andWO#2 entering the driver’s seat of the unmarked police vehicle.  As soon as they were inside their vehicle,SO#1 madeWO#1 aware that she had been struck by the Traverse and that she was experiencing pain to her left shoulder.This evidence is confirmed by the radio transmission fromSO#1 at 1:47 a.m., wherein she is originally heard to report that a vehicle had failed to stop at theRIDEand then, 14 seconds later, that the vehicle had struck her left arm.SO#1 also provided the Traverse’s direction of travel as going southbound on the 410 Hwy at approximately 194 km/h and exiting at Steeles Avenue.  Furthermore,SO#1 requested that the Peel Regional Police (PRP) be advised that they were immediately needed.WO#1 is then heard to come on the radio at 1:47:55 a.m., and provide the vehicle description, along with a partial licence plate, a brief description of the driver, and its direction of travel;WO#1 then continually updated the dispatcher as new information became available.  At 1:50:09 a.m.,WO#1 then provided the speed of their police vehicle as travelling at 182 km/h, in an attempt to catch up to, and stop, the Traverse.On this evidence, I find that at the time that theSAPwas initiated, the four police officers had ample grounds to stop and investigate the Traverse’s driver for possible signs of impairment based on his refusal to stop at theRIDE, failing to stop for police when directed, dangerous driving causing bodily harm, and possibly assault with a weapon (the weapon being the motor vehicle itself, which was used to strikeSO#1). As such, there appears ample evidence to support the decision of the police officers to initiate a police pursuit at that time, and they were clearly acting lawfully in doing so.The communications recording provides what appears to be a simultaneous narrative of the pursuit, in thatWO#1 and the other officers are continually heard to relay their location, and the location of the Traverse, as they progress, along with the speeds at which they are travelling.  WhileWO#1 is heard to relay that one police officer had been struck by the vehicle, a female officer, possibly from the second police vehicle, then indicated that two police officers had been struck, from which I find that the second officer was referring to the front bumper of the Traverse having made contact withWO#2, who had to move out of the way to avoid being struck by the mirror, but was not injured.It is further clear from the communications recording whereinSO#2 is heard at 1:50:11 a.m. asking the involved police officers if they were in pursuit only because the Traverse had failed to stop for theRIDEcheck, that from that point onwards,SO#2 was monitoring the pursuit from theOPPHeadquarters in Orillia.  In response toSO#2’s question, he was informed not only of the fact that an officer had been struck, but that the vehicle was now driving on the wrong side of the road.SO#2’s notes indicate that he considered these grounds sufficient to justify a pursuit.At 1:50:58 a.m.,WO#1 is heard to report that the Traverse was now driving on the wrong side of the road on Airport Road and, at 1:53:04 a.m., that the Traverse was now driving in the oncoming lane of traffic on Humberwood Boulevard.  On a number of occasions, the situation was described as now being a “wrong way” situation, which is specifically referred to in theOPPpolicies as being a serious situation justifying immediate action by police[1].At 1:54:19 a.m.,WO#2 is heard to call in that she had just managed to obtain the full licence plate of the Traverse.  Subsequent inquiries by the dispatcher, however, indicated that this licence plate was not registered to the Traverse vehicle and it was subsequently confirmed that the licence plate had in fact been reported stolen.At 1:52:54 a.m., the radio transmission recording revealsSO#1 stating that they, “Need Peel now!”  At 1:55:05 a.m.,WO#1 is heard to instructWO#2 to stay back behind their vehicle and, at 1:57:07 a.m., as they entered Toronto,WO#1 indicated that the Toronto Police were required (“Need Toronto! Need Toronto!”), and at 1:58:32 a.m.,WO#1 again reported that the Traverse was driving in the oncoming lane of traffic on Rexdale Boulevard.On each occasion when assistance was requested from another police service, the dispatcher is heard to confirm that the relevant police service had been notified and was ‘patching in,’ from which I infer that each police service was monitoring the pursuit.At 2:00:57 a.m., the involved units are again heard requesting assistance, this time advising that they were approaching the 407 toll highway and that they needed to, “Get 407 (OPP) units here!”At 2:01:54 a.m., it is clear from the communications recording that the collision has occurred, and within seconds, at 2:01:59 hours,SO#1 can be heard out of the vehicle yelling at the occupants of the Traverse to exit their vehicle.  At 2:02:36 a.m., a request is heard for a sergeant to attend immediately, following which there are requests for ambulances and that theSIUwill need to be notified.The duration of the police pursuit appears to have been approximately 14 minutes and travelled over approximately 32.8 kilometres.During the police pursuit, Complainant #1’s speeds were described as being as high as between 160 to 200 km/h and, specifically, on Morningstar Drive, a smaller residential street with a 50 km/h speed limit, the Traverse was estimated as travelling at 130 km/h.  The Traverse was also observed to proceed through several red lights and stop signs without stopping, in addition to driving on the wrong side of the road and nearly becoming involved in several head-on collisions.  From this evidence, it is clear that Complainant #1, and the Traverse he was operating, posed a serious danger of causing serious injury, if not death, to other users of the roadway.TheGPSdata from the two police vehicles is consistent with their reported speeds as recorded in the communications recording, with the maximum speeds reached being 196 km/h, which was at the outset of the pursuit on the 410 Hwy with a speed limit of 100 km/h, and then decreasing.The variousCCTVrecordings obtained from various premises along the pursuit route confirms that the weather was clear, traffic was light, with no pedestrian traffic being noted, and that both police vehicles had their emergency equipment activated during the pursuit, while the pursuit video confirms that the road conditions were goodTheCDRdata from the Traverse confirms that the vehicle was travelling at an excessive rate of speed, 147 km/h, five seconds prior to making contact with the curb at the dead end on Kipling Avenue, after which its speed sharply decreased and the driver had slowed to 28 km/h within half a second of impact, after which he continued to brake until he had slowed to 11 km/h, when the Traverse struck the ditch.Examination of both police vehicles showed no evidence that either ever made contact with the Traverse, with the only damage being toSO#1’s vehicle, which was consistent with her having struck a fire hydrant when she came to a final stop.  I note that there is no allegation by Complainant #1 that any police vehicle ever made contact with his vehicle, or that police caused him to lose control, resulting in the collision.While Ontario Regulation 266/10, of the OntarioPolice Services Act(OPSA) entitled Suspect Apprehension Pursuits, indicates that an officer in an unmarked police motor vehicle shall not engage in aSAPunless a marked police vehicle is not readily available, I note that every effort was made by the officers involved, the dispatcher, andSO#2, to have other marked units from not only theOPP, but also thePRPand theTPS, attend to take over the pursuit, but none were available in the area.With respect to the obligations placed on officers involved in a police pursuit, I note that the requirements as set out both under theOPSAand theOPPguidelines were substantially complied with, including notifying the communications centre that a pursuit had been initiated and constantly updating the dispatcher as to speeds and location.  I further note that pursuant to both theOPPpolicy and theOPSA, the officers had valid grounds to initiate a pursuit, initially in order to attempt to identify the motor vehicle which they had observed to commit a criminal offence, and then thereafter, despite having identified the licence plate of the motor vehicle at 1:54:19 a.m., to continue the pursuit as the situation had then progressed to a potentially “life threatening situation” in that the Traverse was travelling at high rates of speed in the oncoming lanes of traffic and posed a serious threat to the public.According to the witness officers involved in the pursuit, it was their intention to make physical contact with the Traverse in order to bring it to a stop, which I note is further authorized under s. 9 (2) of Regulation 266/10, which authorizes intentional physical contact between a police vehicle and “a fleeing motor vehicle for the purposes of stopping it only if the officer believes on reasonable grounds that to do so is necessary to immediately protect against loss of life or serious bodily harm”.  As theOPPpolicy specifically indicates that a vehicle being driven on the wrong side of the road is a ‘life threatening occurrence’, it is clear that physical contact, if it had occurred, would arguably be justified in these circumstances.Despite finding that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the police officers substantially complied with theSuspect Apprehension Pursuit Policypursuant to theOPSA, the question remains whether, on these facts, there are reasonable grounds to believe that any of the officers involved in the pursuit of the Traverse, or who were monitoring the pursuit as communications supervisor, committed a criminal offence, specifically, whether or not the driving rose to the level of being dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249 (1) of theCriminal Codeand did thereby cause bodily harm contrary to s.249 (3) or if the pursuit amounted to an act of criminal negligence contrary to s.219 of theCriminal Codeand did thereby cause bodily harm (s.221).The decision of the Supreme Court of CanadaR v Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, defines s.249 as requiring that the driving be dangerous to the public, “having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place” and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances”; while the offence under s.219 requires “a marked and substantial departure from the standard of a reasonable driver in circumstances” where the accused “showed a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others” (R v Sharp(1984), 12 CCC(3d) 428 Ont CA).On a review of all of the evidence, while it is clear that the two police vehicles were travelling at speeds well in excess of the posted speed limit, I accept that there was little vehicular and no pedestrian traffic, the weather and driving conditions were good, and that the police officers had observed Complainant #1 to commit a criminal act in strikingSO#1 with his motor vehicle.I also find that while Complainant #1’s manner of driving posed an immediate and significant danger to others motorists, it appears that the dangerous nature of his driving preceded the police pursuit, in that even prior to the four police officers entering their police vehicles with the intention of either stopping and investigating the driver for a criminal offence, or determining if he was fit to drive, Complainant #1 drove off at a significant rate of speed, struckSO#1, and to a lesser degreeWO#2, and then drove in such a manner as to put other motorists at risk, in his efforts to avoid both theRIDEcheck and to flee from police.  When Complainant #1 then later resorted to driving either on the wrong side of the road, or the wrong way on one way streets, narrowly avoiding several head-on collisions, his driving put the public at such a high risk that the consideration of public safety dictated that he had to be apprehended and stopped.Additionally, I find that there is no evidence that the driving, by any of the police officers, created a danger to other users of the roadway or that at any time they interfered with other traffic, other than that their approach caused other motorists to pull over to the side of the road, as required by law.On all of the evidence before me, I cannot find any connection between the actions of the police in attempting to stop Complainant #1, who was a clear and imminent danger to the lives of others, and the injuries sustained by Complainant #2 and Complainant #1 himself.  On this record, it is clear that Complainant #1 chose to drive in a manner which was dangerous to others and that he had no regard for the possible loss of life that his driving could lead to, both before and after the police initiated a vehicular pursuit.I find that the four police officers engaged in the vehicular pursuit, to attempt to either stop and/or identify the driver of the Traverse, as well asSO#2, who was monitoring the pursuit, used their best efforts in what was a very fast paced and dynamic situation, with little time for planning out strategies.  Specifically, I find that the constant communication between the involved police officers and the dispatcher, wherein they provided all available information about the pursuit and the subject vehicle, as well as the repeated and urgent demands bySO#1 for the assistance of uniformed units from various police services, indicates that they were very aware of their obligations during a pursuit and they were making every effort to comply and to bring the pursuit to an end as quickly and safely as possible.I find, on this evidence, that the driving of the police officers involved in the pursuit and the attempt to stop the Traverse, and to apprehend Complainant #1, does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute ‘a marked departure from the norm’ and even less so ‘a marked and substantial departure from the norm’ and there is no evidence to establish any causal connection between the actions of the pursuing officers and the motor vehicle collision which resulted in the injuries to the occupants of the Traverse.I further find thatSO#2, who fully monitored the pursuit, who questioned the surrounding facts and the justification in conducting the pursuit, and who made every effort to bring in other resources to bring the pursuit to a safe end, was acting fully within the ambits not only of the responsibilities of his position, but also the requirements of both theOPSA,OPPpolicy, and theCriminal Code.As such, I find that there is no evidence upon which I can form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed by any of the police officers involved in the vehicular pursuit of the Traverse motor vehicle, and therefore there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges.Date:	February 20, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=244
,Ontario Provincial Police,Peterborough,Ontario,The Complainant was later diagnosed with a fractured orbital bone,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=305
,Hamilton Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario,In the Post-Mortem Report the pathologist concluded that the cause of death was “a penetrating gunshot wound of the abdomen complicated by massive blood loss,"A 911 call was received by the Hamilton Police Service (HPS) communications centre at 8:56:38 p.m., wherein the caller reported hearing a, “loud bang,” which he thought, “was a gunshot at Sanford and Main”.At 8:57:11 p.m. on December 2, 2017, while the 911 caller was still online with theHPScall taker, and only 33 seconds after the call was first received, the first police cruiser was dispatched to 581 Main Street East for possible shots fired.  At 8:57:36 p.m., a second police cruiser was dispatched on the call, at 8:57:38 p.m., a third, and by 8:58:11 p.m., a fourth cruiser had been dispatched.At 8:58:54 p.m., the first police officer to arrive at the location of the reported gun shot, the Subject Officer (SO), is recorded on the communications tape as reporting that he was at the location with the [injured] party. At 8:59:00 p.m., theSOreported that there was a ‘man down’ and, at 8:59:02 p.m., he requested that an ambulance be called; the request for an ambulance appears to have been made only eight seconds after theSOarrived at the Complainant’s location.  TheSOfurther reported, as recorded in the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) event details report, that a ‘BB gun’ was possibly involved, and that the male had ‘minor injuries, superficial to abdomen’.By 8:59:27 p.m., a further two police cruisers had been dispatched to the area.  At 8:59:31 p.m., 29 seconds after theSO’s request that an ambulance be dispatched, the communications centre notified theEMSand requested that an ambulance be dispatched to the gun call.Additional police cruisers continued to be notified and dispatched, with the number of responding units having increased to 11, including a canine unit, by 9:06:13 p.m.At 9:58:41 p.m., theHPSwas notified that the Complainant had been pronounced dead at hospital.During the course of this investigation, the statements taken from 63 civilian and two police witnesses were obtained and reviewed. The Niagara Regional Police Service (NRPS) - an independent police service that had been requested to step in and investigate the response of the emergency services (police and paramedics) to the treatment of the Complainant - was in possession of the subject officer’s video-recorded statement. With the consent of the subject officer, the SIU obtained and reviewed this statement. Many of the 63 civilian witnesses were interviewed by both theHPS, initially, and after the investigation was transferred to theNRPS, they were interviewed again.  While theSIUwas not officially notified until April 27, 2018, which then triggered our mandate, theSIUinvestigator had to rely on all of the evidence originally obtained by both theHPSand theNRPS, as the delay in notification eliminated the possibility of theSIUgathering any evidence independent of the police investigations.  The following sequence of events has been extrapolated from the credible and reliable evidence obtained, including the witness statements, the 911 call recording, the police transmissions communications recordings, and surveillance video from the area.Of the 63 civilian witnesses (CWs) interviewed, very few heard the actual shot, saw the impact on the Complainant, and then observed his injury. Of those, only one indicated in his statement to the police that he believed that the Complainant had actually been shot by a real firearm, because he heard a really loud gun shot, with the remaining witnesses describing the shooter as: using a “modified pellet gun” (CW#1); hearing a sound that he did not believe was a gunshot (CW#9); sounding like a BB gun (CW#17); or a “pop” and being “almost like a CO2 cartridge going off” (CW#16); hearing “a bang” that “sounded like a fire cracker” (CW#37); and, not sounding like a gun, but rather a pellet gun (CW#43).  There is no question that, upon the arrival of the police, many of the witnesses informed the police officers that the Complainant had been shot by a pellet gun, a BB gun, or had been injured by a firecracker.Additionally, three witnesses indicated that they were told either by the brother and/or friends of the Complainant that the Complainant had been shot by a BB gun, withCW#5 reporting that the Complainant’s brother,CW#1 had run into the mosque and reported that the Complainant had been shot by a BB gun, whileCW#6 was told, both by one of his friends and by his brother, that the Complainant had been shot with a BB gun.CW#42, who went down to the location where the Complainant was lying on the sidewalk, described both the Complainant and his friend telling her that he had been shot by a pellet gun.In addition to the few friends of the Complainant, and his brother, who were present, there were a number ofCWs who both heard the shot and saw the Complainant’s treatment by emergency responders.  Of those present,CW#17 described hearing a “pop” sound, following which he saw the Complainant’s brother run into the convenience store;  when the Complainant’s brother,CW#1, reported that his brother had been shot,CW#17 told him that, “It sounded just like a BB gun.”CW#17 then attended to the Complainant’s location and described seeing a, “little bit” of blood on the wound site, with no blood coming out from the wound itself.  He indicated that, in his view, it looked like the skin was just broken and there was just a little mark, and he again questioned if the source of the injury might be a BB gun.CW#17 was also present when the first police officer, theSO, arrived; he described theSOas exiting his police cruiser with urgency, whereuponCW#17 approached the officer and told him that the wound may have been caused by, “Looks like a BB gun.”CW#17 then observed theSOto kneel down in front of the Complainant and shine a flashlight in the wound, before reporting over the radio that it looked like a minor wound.  According to theCADevent details report generated by the communications computer, this call came in to theHPScommunications centre at 8:59:24 p.m.CW#17 found no fault in the behaviour or actions of theSO, concluding instead that the police officers did what they had to do before they turned the Complainant over toEMSpersonnel.CW#16, the son ofCW#17, who was with his father at the time, also described the initial sound heard as being a “pop” and being “almost like a CO2 cartridge going off.”  He went on to indicate that this was why, “We were confused when we found out it was a real gun” and that, “Nobody was really, including myself, was under the impression that that sounded like a gun.”CW#16, who observed his father apply pressure to the Complainant’s wound, described seeing “a little scratch” which appeared to him to be a closed wound, not deep at all, and there being a lack of blood.CW#16 also heard some bystanders and the Complainant’s brother report that the Complainant had been shot with a gun, while others said it was a BB gun or a firecracker.  AsCW#16 andCW#17 were driving away,CW#16 observed his father stop the car, lower the window, and tell the police officer who was tending to the Complainant that the Complainant was only in shock; he described his father’s tone as being in a “don’t worry” manner.CW#16 was of the view that the police response at the scene was very professional, amid the confusion.Additionally, numerous of theCWs, who saw the actual injury to the Complainant, appeared to confirm their previous impression that the injury was caused by a pellet or BB gun, as a result of observing what appeared to be the minor nature of the injury, with many describing seeing very little blood and only a small hole.  Of specific note, a number of the firefighters described the injury as being “a little tiny, so small, wound in his lower belly” (CW#32); “almost no blood” and  that it “appeared to be consistent with a BB gun injury” (CW#45); and, seeing a small wound with a little bit of blood around the navel (CW#48).  Of the 14 non-police civilian witnesses who observed the injury, all described it in similar terms, that being very small, with little or no blood, and they also concluded that the injury was so minor as to be consistent with having been caused by something other than an actual firearm.WhileCW#24 described the injury, which he observed, as being to the Complainant’s chest and that it was an open hole with blood, I do not accept this evidence, as both the location and the nature of the injury is inconsistent with the evidence of the other reliable witnesses, who had a better view of the injury, and the subsequent observations made during the post-mortem examination. I can only surmise, on this evidence, thatCW#24’s recollection of the event, in hindsight, may have been influenced by the media coverage and/or the tragic death of the Complainant.Based on the evidence obtained during the course of this investigation, including theCADevents report, I note that theSOwas dispatched at 8:58:11 p.m. (not being the first cruiser dispatched to the scene) and was the first officer to arrive on scene, reporting in at 8:58:54 p.m., only 43 seconds after first having been notified.  Additionally, upon his arrival, he was observed to exit his cruiser with urgency (CW#17) and to immediately approach the Complainant and to check his injury with a flashlight.  At 8:59:02 p.m., only eight seconds after his arrival, theSOpromptly requested that the ambulance service be notified to attend.  TheSOwas then observed to place the Complainant into the recovery position (CW#9).  This evidence is also consistent with the statement of theSO.While theSOwaved off firefighters when they went to approach the Complainant (CW#32,CW#45), indicating that the wound was minor in nature, the evidence is that as soon as the paramedics arrived, the Complainant was turned over and put into their hands to be assessed and treated accordingly.  It is clear that, as the only medical professionals on scene, the responsibility for the care and treatment of the Complainant then fell to the paramedics.  It is further clear, that after having been told by numerous witnesses that the Complainant had been shot with a pellet or a BB gun and, after observing what appeared to be a very minor injury which appeared consistent with that information, theSOthen relayed that same misinformation to both fire andEMSpersonnel.There was an allegation that the police officers on scene were rude and insensitive.  While this behaviour, if it occurred, is far from commendable and not consistent with the sworn duties of acting police officers, neither is it criminal in nature, unless that behaviour somehow interfered with the care of the Complainant, and thereby contributed to his death.  With respect to that allegation, however, I find that the evidence is in conflict, with a number of witnesses indicating that the only thing that the police officers did was to accuse the Complainant of feigning an injury or exaggerating his injury, while others claimed that the police officers were openly laughing and joking, while the Complainant lay writhing in pain on the sidewalk.CW#19, who did not hear the shot, but was alerted by her son, observed the arrival of the police officers at the scene.  She described the actions of the police officers as seeming “to be doing their job” and that they were over with the Complainant and that they “looked after him.”CW#19 also described the police officers turning the Complainant over to the paramedics when they arrived, and the paramedics then “took over.”  WhileCW#19 did hear some laughing, she noted that did not occur until after the paramedics had arrived and she could not determine who, specifically, was the source of the laughter. This evidence is also consistent with the evidence ofCW#23, in that she too only heard laughter after the arrival of the paramedics, with her specifically describing one paramedic as “joking around”, whileCW#24 described hearing one of the paramedics laughing and saying that the Complainant was fine and just over-reacting.CW#27, on the other hand, observed the “cops just standing there talking and giggling” and that he later saw the paramedics and the police officers standing by joking around with each other.”CW#20, who heard someone say that the Complainant was feigning injury, indicated that he could not determine who said that, but that it was said after the arrival of the paramedics.As indicated earlier, while this behaviour, if joined in by any police officers at the scene would shine a very poor light on theHPS, nevertheless, while the evidence satisfies me that some of the first responders at the scene accused the Complainant of feigning or exaggerating his injury, and those individuals or others may have laughed and joked around, the evidence does not satisfy me that this behaviour can specifically be attributed to theSOor any other named police officer present, nor is there any evidence that the behaviour of any police officer present interfered with, or prevented, the paramedics from assessing the Complainant’s condition and providing him with the necessary medical care and attention.Furthermore, since the evidence is clear, that despite the information received by theSO, and his observation of the injury, upon which he formulated a conclusion that the injury was minor in nature, that conclusion, which was ultimately erroneous, does not appear to have interfered with theSOcarrying out his duties in that he immediately requested that an ambulance be notified, he placed the Complainant into the recovery position, and he turned the Complainant over to paramedics upon their arrival and did not interfere with the exercise of their duties as medical professionals.The only criminal charge open for consideration, on these facts, would be one of criminal negligence causing death contrary to s.220 of theCriminal Code.  There is no dispute that the death of the Complainant was directly caused by the gunshot by one of the two males who was harassing the older gentleman, and not directly attributable to the actions of any police officer.  The only question to be addressed, then, being whether or not any police officer failed in his duty toward the Complainant.  Specifically, the question to be posed is whether theSOomitted to do anything that it was his duty to do and, in failing to do so, showed a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of the Complainant (s.219 of theCriminal Code:  definition of criminal negligence).  It should also be noted that there is no offence of criminal negligence in isolation, in that the behaviour only becomes criminal if it can be proven that it contributed to, or caused, death or bodily harm.There are numerous decisions of the higher courts defining the requirements to prove an offence of criminal negligence; while most relate to offences involving driving, the courts have made it clear that the same principles apply to other behaviour as well.  In order to find reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted the offence of criminal negligence causing death, one must first have reasonable grounds to believe that he had a duty toward the Complainant which he omitted to carry out, and that omission, pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v J.F.(2008), 3 S.C.R. 215, represented ‘amarked and substantial departurefrom the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in circumstances’ where this officer ‘either recognized and ran an obvious and serious risk to the life’ of the Complainant ‘or, alternatively, gave no thought to that risk’.  The courts have also made clear that the risk of death to the Complainant must have been foreseeable to theSO(R. v Shilon(2006), 240 C.C.C. (3d) 401 Ont. C.A.).It is clear, on a review of all of the evidence, that the Complainant was shot in the abdomen by an unidentified assailant.  It is equally clear that theSO, relying upon the information he had received from numerous witnesses who either heard or saw the shooting, and appearing to confirm that evidence independently himself, by viewing the injury to the Complainant, mistakenly formed the erroneous conclusion that the Complainant had been shot by a BB or pellet pistol and that his injury was minor in nature.  Having done that, however, I take specific note that theSOdid not allow that conclusion to interfere with his sworn duties, in that he immediately notified dispatch that an ambulance was required for the Complainant, he placed the Complainant into the recovery position, and, once paramedics arrived, he placed the care of the Complainant into their hands and he did not in any way interfere with the Complainant’s care or treatment.  Once the Complainant’s care was transferred over to the paramedics, the responsibility for his care clearly fell to them, as long as theSOdid not interfere with their ability to perform their duties which is not alleged here.During the post-mortem examination, the forensic pathologist noted that she observed a single, lethal, penetrating gunshot wound to the abdomen.  The entry wound was a “tiny wound, zero point five millimetres… a very small hole basically… in the low abdomen.”  A non-deformed small calibre bullet was recovered from the pelvic cavity.The pathologist further determined that two major blood vessels, an artery and a vein, had been damaged by the bullet which resulted in a massive bleed with two litres of blood being found to have pooled in the abdominal cavity and another approximately 500 mls of blood clots being observed in the abdominal wall, which led to the conclusion that the Complainant had lost a significant amount of blood volume internally, which was the direct cause of his death.The pathologist opined that, “if only one vessel is hit, the chances for survival are better but if both, that worsens the prognosis.  This is regardless of having surgery promptly… that’s just the nature of the injuries… It’s logical.  The more vessels are hit, the worse the prognosis is.”While the pathologist determined that the death of the Complainant was attributable to “a penetrating gunshot wound of the abdomen complicated by massive blood loss,” she also made the further qualifying comment that, “the assumption that the decedent would have survived had he been promptly admitted to the nearest trauma centre is false,” adding that,”  “the nature of his (the Complainant’s) injuries was the strongest determinant of poor outcome.”On the record before me, the evidence establishes that despite the misinformation that was relayed to theSO, and despite the fact that he accepted and relied upon that misinformation, which he later relayed to other emergency responders, and despite the appearance of the Complainant’s injury, which appeared to confirm that erroneous information, theSO, in fact, was aware of his duty to the Complainant and he carried out those duties, regardless of  his belief that the Complainant’s injury was minor in nature, in that he immediately notified the dispatcher that the Complainant required an ambulance and, upon arrival of the paramedics, he turned the Complainant over to theEMSpersonnel and he neither delayed, nor interfered with, the medical assessment and treatment of the Complainant.While it is not within my mandate to determine culpability in the tragic death of the Complainant beyond determining the responsibility of the police officers who responded to the 911 call, it is within my mandate, and I find, that the evidence satisfies me that the actions of theSOneither directly contributed to the Complainant’s death, nor did he fail to carry out his duties as required by law, which may thereby have indirectly contributed to the Complainant’s death.In conclusion, I find that the actions of theSOfell within the parameters of the criminal law, in that theSOappears to have been cognizant of his duties pursuant to s. 219 of theCriminal Codeand he acted accordingly.  While it is clear that the death of the Complainant was apparently not foreseeable to theSO, or indeed to the majority of the witnesses at the scene, it appears that theSO’s actions were fully in accord with his responsibilities in any event.  As such, as I do not find that the evidence satisfies me on reasonable grounds that the actions of theSO, or any respondingHPSofficer, are capable of forming the basis for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	March 20, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=284

,,Cornwall,Ontario,” The Complainant was discharged without any treatment required as the fracture was expected to heal without medical intervention,"At 11:29 p.m., the Complainant was located in the area of Brookdale Avenue and Cornwall Centre Road in the City of Cornwall, where he was arrested byWO#1 for breaching the conditions of his bail release; he was then transported to the police station.During the course of the Complainant’s time in custody, he sustained an injury and he was taken to the hospital, where it was discovered that he had sustained a fracture to his nasal spine.Since the Complainant appears to have been injured while in police custody, either at the roadside or inside the police station and away from public view, there were no civilian witnesses to the incident, with the Complainant being the only civilian interviewed.  In addition to the Complainant, however, five police witnesses, as well as the subject officer, theSO, were interviewed, with all providing their memorandum book notes toSIUinvestigators for review.Additionally, and fortunately, the inside of theCCPSstation was under constant video surveillance, and almost every second of the Complainant’s time in custody at the station was recorded onCCTV, which was provided toSIUinvestigators.  While the Complainant failed to mention in his statement both his obstructive behaviour, and his physical resistance, which were clearly seen on theCCTVfootage, causing me to approach with caution the reliability of his account of his interactions with the police officers, the fact remains that the Complainant was injured during his interaction with them on April 21, 2018, requiring a determination of whether or not the injury was caused as a result of an excessive use of force by any of the officers who had contact with him.  The following narrative is derived from theCCTVfootage, along with the reliable eyewitness evidence.The Complainant, in his statement to theSIU, related that he was walking on Brookdale Avenue at about midnight on April 21, 2018, when he saw a marked police cruiser driving parallel to him, but he kept walking.  The Complainant described himself at that time as having consumed a number of alcoholic beverages and he placed himself at a five or a six on a scale of one to ten for sobriety, with ten being falling down drunk; at no time in his statement, does the Complainant make any reference to being at his former girlfriend’s residence earlier that evening.As he was walking, the Complainant alleges thatWO#1 grabbed him from behind, swung him around, and forced his head against the hood of the police cruiser.  The Complainant was then told that he was being charged with breaching the conditions of his bail release, and he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back and pushed into the rear seat of the police cruiser, face down, and told to stay there and be quiet.  The Complainant alleged that he told the officers several times that he wished to speak with his lawyer and that he required medical attention, as his jaw hurt from striking the hood of the police car.WO#1, followed byWO#2 in a separate police cruiser, then transported the Complainant to the police station.  Once in the garage area of the police station,WO#1 andWO#2 walked the Complainant into the booking area, where theSOwas present.  The Complainant recalled that he again demanded to speak with his lawyer and to get medical attention, but theSOtold him to calm down, so he (the Complainant) stopped talking.  At that point, he alleges, theSOtold the Complainant that he presumed, from his actions, that he no longer wished to speak with counsel.  TheSOthen had the two uniformed police officers remove the handcuffs from the back of his body, and he was re-handcuffed to the front, in order to accommodate his being searched.According to the Complainant, theSOthen held the Complainant’s face against a cement block wall to search his pockets and clothing; this was done in the presence of three or four police officers.  The Complainant agreed that he was agitated at the time, and was yelling that he wanted to speak to a lawyer.  At one point, the Complainant was able to turn to face theSO, and he screamed at him about his right to counsel.The Complainant indicated, in his statement, that theSOthen took him by the right arm and the back of his head, and pulled him forcefully to the floor, where he landed on his right side and then rolled onto his back.  TheSOthen punched the Complainant in the face with his left fist, three times, causing him severe pain to his right cheek, nose, and lips; he was also bleeding from his nose and mouth.Other police officers then dragged the Complainant to a cell and placed him face down on the concrete bed.  The Complainant spat blood on the wall of the cell and vomited into the toilet. Two of the police officers, one of whom wasWO#2, then stayed near his cell until he had calmed down, at which pointWO#2 removed the Complainant’s handcuffs and told him that she would arrange for a call to his lawyer.  After speaking to his lawyer, the police officers called for an ambulance and the Complainant was taken to the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a fractured nose.There is little dispute between the evidence of the Complainant and the police officers, including theSO, as to the actions of police inside the police station, and there is no dispute that theSOstruck the Complainant; the differences between the evidence of the Complainant and theSOappear more in the nature of why theSOstruck the Complainant, and the actions of the Complainant, while in custody.According toWO#1, while he agrees that he approached and exited his police cruiser on Brookdale Avenue, after he had driven alongside of the Complainant, who ignored the presence of the police officer and the police cruiser, his statement differs from that of the Complainant in thatWO#1 indicated that he approached the Complainant and immediately took physical control by holding the Complainant’s left arm and pushing on the back of his shoulder, causing the Complainant to turn slightly sideways and lean across the hood of his police cruiser.WO#1 described using his right forearm to put enough pressure on the Complainant’s back to hold him in place, while holding the Complainant’s hands together with his left hand;WO#1 then informed the Complainant that he was under arrest for breaching the conditions of his bail release.WO#1 described the Complainant as arguing and indicating that he had only been walking down the street and that, at least twice, he tried to stand up, butWO#1 was able to hold him in place over the hood of the police cruiser.  Upon the arrival ofWO#2, the Complainant was then handcuffed with his hands behind his back andWO#1 again told the Complainant the reason for his arrest and read him his right to counsel (pursuant to theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, s. 10).WO#1 further described the Complainant as ignoringWO#1, refusing to acknowledge that he had been advised of his right to counsel, refusing to indicate whether or not he wished to exercise his right to counsel, continuously speaking overWO#1, and demanding medical attention for his sore jaw.With the exception of the opinion ofWO#1 that the Complainant refused to indicate whether or not he wished to contact counsel, this evidence is substantially consistent with that ofWO#2, who indicated in her statement that upon her arrival, she observedWO#1 to have the Complainant bent forward over the hood of his police cruiser and was holding him down on the hood.WO#2 then approached and handcuffed the Complainant with his hands behind his back.  She described the Complainant as being very agitated, and yelling loudly to the effect that the police had no reason to arrest him and demanding to speak with a lawyer.NeitherWO#1, norWO#2, indicated that they used any force, or observed any force used, against the Complainant at the roadside.Upon arrival at the police station,WO#1 described the Complainant as refusing to exit the police cruiser on his own, instead lying down across the rear seat forcingWO#1 to reach into the cruiser and pull the Complainant out by the waistband of his pants.  Once the Complainant was on his feet outside of the car, he did not want to walk inside and he had to be assisted, withWO#1 andWO#2 on either side of him.  Once inside the booking room, the Complainant was seated on a stool beside the table from which theSO, the booking sergeant, carried out the booking process.This evidence is consistent with that ofWO#2, who also indicated that when she entered the sally port she saw the Complainant lying across the rear seat, face down, and refusing to exit the police cruiser, causingWO#1 to reach in and pull him out by the waistband of his pants.  Thereafter,WO#2 described the Complainant as not wanting to walk into the booking hall and that she andWO#1 had to assist him, with one officer on each side.Despite the Complainant’s failure to mention his obstructive behaviour in the sally port and his refusal to exit the police cruiser, theCCTVfrom the sally port/garage area, although without audio, appears to confirm that whileWO#1 is seen to open the rear passenger door for the Complainant to exit the vehicle, he stands and speaks to him for some moments, followed byWO#2 coming over and looking into the rear seat, and finally, after 91 seconds of discussion,WO#1 pulls the Complainant out of the cruiser.  Thereafter, the Complainant appears to stand on one spot, swaying back and forth, whileWO#1 links his arm under that of the Complainant and then walks him into the station.WO#2, in her statement, outlined how, once the Complainant was seated on a stool in the booking hall in front of theSO, he refused to answer any questions or to acknowledge that he heard what theSOwas asking him, instead continually yelling loudly about his rights, about wanting to speak with a lawyer, and about wanting medical attention for his jaw.This evidence is consistent with that ofWO#1, who also added that when the Complainant was asked his lawyer’s name, he refused to provide it.Because the video of the booking room does not have audio, I am unable to determine, from theCCTVfootage, exactly what was being said in the booking room at the time, but, as the evidence of all three of the police officers present is consistent in this regard, and, as indicated by theSOin his interview, the booking record for the Complainant simply has a line through it with the word, “refused” written across it, I find that the Complainant was indeed refusing to answer any questions posed to him by theSO.WO#1 further advised that in order to facilitate a search of the Complainant, prior to his being lodged in the cells, he and theSOstood the Complainant up, facing a cement block wall, and held him against it, while the Complainant’s handcuffs were removed to allow for the removal of his winter jacket.The statement ofWO#2, who was standing nearby and watching whileWO#1 and theSOdealt with the Complainant, is again consistent in this regard with the evidence ofWO#1, as it is with theCCTVfootage.  While the Complainant, in his statement, alleged that theSOheld the Complainant’s face against a cement block wall in order to conduct the search, I note that the video, while revealing that the Complainant is leaned against the wall and appears to rest his forehead against the wall, also reveals that no one is holding his face against a cement block wall; in fact, he appears to be leaning against some type of whiteboard on the wall, and it isWO#1 who is holding him by the right arm, while theSOsearches him.WO#1 then left the booking room.  OnceWO#1 was outside of the booking room,WO#2 observed the Complainant flail his arms and theSOrespond by trying to take the Complainant to the floor.WO#2 described theSOputting the Complainant into a headlock, following which there was a short tussle, and both men fell to the floor, with the Complainant lying on his back.WO#2 then moved to the Complainant’s legs, in order to assist theSO, who was straddling the Complainant;WO#1 then also returned to the room to assist.WO#2 then observed theSOdeliver several strikes to the Complainant with his right arm, but she could not see where the strikes landed.Similarly,WO#1 described hearing raised voices and the sounds of a scuffle, causing him to return to the booking room, where he saw that theSOhad the Complainant in a sort of headlock and was attempting to turn him around, when both men fell to the floor, with the Complainant landing on his right side, face up, and rolling onto his back.  TheSOthen straddled the Complainant, whileWO#1 went to the area of the Complainant’s head in order to assist.WO#1 recalled seeing theSOthen make several arm movements, which may have been punches, but he too was unable to see, because of the position of the parties on the floor, where or if the blows landed on the Complainant.When viewing the video at slow speed, however, I noted the following:At 11:51:40 p.m.WO#1 leaves the room after removing the Complainant’s ring from his hand. The Complainant, who had been facing the wall, was then turned to face forward by theSO, who maintains his hold on the Complainant’s left arm.  The Complainant then pulls his left arm away from theSOand theSOplaces his right hand on the Complainant’s left shoulder and his left hand on the Complainant’s right side, as if to calm him.  The Complainant then raises both of his hands to push the arms of theSOaway, and then raises his left hand and arm in theSO’s face.At 11:51:46 p.m.TheSOimmediately pushes the Complainant sideways and places his forearm to the back of the Complainant’s head/neck area.  When the Complainant continues to struggle, theSOthen places his forearm around the Complainant’s neck and puts him into a headlock and pulls him down towards the floor.At 11:51:48 p.m.While going to the floor, and with the Complainant still violently struggling, the Complainant falls onto his back and theSOfalls with him.At 11:51:59 p.m.All three officers are now over top of the Complainant, trying to control him, withWO#2 holding his legs down,WO#1 pinning his upper body down with his own upper body, and theSOover top of the Complainant, holding him down.From 11:52:01 until 11:52:24 p.m.All movement stops and the officers are still while holding the Complainant down, as if waiting for him to calm.At 11:52:34 p.m.TheSOgets up.WO#2 hands the handcuffs to theSOand the Complainant is handcuffed.WO#1 continues to pin the Complainant down using his own upper body.BothWO#2 andWO#1 then described the Complainant as being rolled over onto his stomach and handcuffed with his hands behind his back, following which he was assisted to his feet.  At that time,WO#1 observed an abrasion to the Complainant’s right check area, with blood visible on his face, whileWO#2 described seeing a small amount of blood on the floor, which she realized originated from the Complainant’s face.  Again this is confirmed on theCCTVfootage.The Complainant was then escorted to the cell area byWO#1 andWO#2 and he was placed face down onto the concrete bed.WO#1 described the Complainant as still being actively resistant, with the Complainant squirming, causing bothWO#1 and the Complainant to stumble into the cell, withWO#1 landing on top of the Complainant, on top of the concrete bed, where the Complainant was left in handcuffs until he calmed down.WO#2 described the Complainant, once in the cell, as still being uncooperative and non-compliant and spitting blood onto the bed and wall.  Once the Complainant calmed down, the cell door was then locked andWO#2 andWO#3 were left to watch the Complainant while he was in his cell;WO#1 left the area.WO#2 then described hearing a thump and seeing the Complainant strike his own head on the wall of the cell.The evidence ofWO#2 is consistent with that ofWO#3, who observed the Complainant bang his head on the concrete wall inside the cell, which he described as the Complainant taking a step and then hitting his head against the wall.WO#3 indicated that he believed that the Complainant’s forehead made contact with the wall, following which the Complainant sat on the floor.At 12:07:09 a.m., the video reveals the Complainant facing the door to his cell, when he takes one step to the right and slams his head into the wall, making contact with the top part of his head, but not his face.According toWO#5, who accompanied the Complainant to the hospital in the ambulance, the Complainant told him that he had been “roughed up” by a large police officer with a bald head and tattoos (whileWO#1 is a large man who is bald, I note that he does not have tattoos, and that it is only theSOwho is both bald and has tattoos, but not nearly as large as isWO#1; as such, I cannot establish with certainty exactly to whom the Complainant was referring as the officer who “roughed” him up) and that he had been punched while he was handcuffed.If the Complainant’s utterance toWO#5 is referring toWO#1 as having “roughed” him up, I note that the only allegation made by the Complainant againstWO#1 is that he smashed his head onto the cruiser of the police vehicle causing his jaw to be sore, whichWO#1 describes as leaning the Complainant over the hood of the cruiser, while applying pressure to his back, to keep him down.  So if this allegation relates to the actions ofWO#1, despite the Complainant’s repeated complaints that his jaw had been injured, I note that the later assessment at the hospital, a CAT scan, and X-rays, all clearly indicated that the Complainant’s jaw was not injured and, this action, if it did indeed occur, did not cause a serious injury, or indeed any injury, to the Complainant.If the Complainant is referring to theSOas being the officer who “roughed” him up, there is no dispute that theSOdelivered three blows to the Complainant in the booking hall. I note, however, that the Complainant was not handcuffed at the time, as he alleged toWO#5, which can be clearly seen in the video, where the Complainant is seen to raise his arms up, as a result of which theSOplaces the Complainant into a headlock and takes him down onto the floor, where theSOis seen to move his arm three times in what appear to be strikes or blows to the Complainant while the Complainant struggles vigorously with the sergeant.  Only when the struggle ends, are the handcuffs seen to be re-applied to the Complainant.Furthermore, since the Complainant is only first seen to have any visible injury or bleeding to the face after his interaction with theSO, when he is on the floor in the booking room, I find that there can be no dispute that the serious injury sustained by the Complainant, that being the nasal spine fracture, occurred when he was on the floor with theSO.  I find, however, that in closely viewing the video, it appears that the abrasion to the Complainant’s face is already visible as soon as he and theSOfall to the floor, and prior to the movement which appears to be theSObringing his elbow back as if to strike the Complainant.  While this is not definitive of when the Complainant’s nose was broken, it appears likely that it occurred when the two men fell to the floor; although it is still possible that it occurred when theSOstruck the Complainant.While there is little disagreement between the evidence of the Complainant, and that of the three police officers, as to what occurred leading up to the Complainant’s injury, I note that the Complainant specifically failed to mention certain aspects of his own behaviour, which causes me some concern as to his credibility and reliability.  A sampling of those omissions follows:The failure of the Complainant to mention his actions at his ex-girlfriend’s home, which led to his arrest, insisting instead that when he was stopped and arrested byWO#1 that he was just walking along and had done nothing wrong;The failure of the Complainant to mention both his refusal to exit the police vehicle, thereby forcingWO#1 to have to physically remove him from the car, and his resistance to walking into the police station;The failure of the Complainant to mention his obstructive behaviour while in front of theSO, including his refusal to answer any questions, his speaking over and ignoring theSO, and his refusal, despite his continuous and loud assertions about wanting to speak to a lawyer, to provide the name of a lawyer, with the Complainant, in his statement, instead indicating that he simply stood quietly after theSOtold him to calm down;The failure of the Complainant to mention that he raised his arms on two occasions at theSO, which is clearly seen on theCCTVfootage, instead indicating only that he managed to turn around and scream at theSO;The Complainant’s clear assertion that he was handcuffed when the incident with theSOtook place, when the video confirms the evidence of all of the officers present, that the Complainant was, in fact, not handcuffed at that time, which allowed him to raise his arms against theSOand struggle vigorously throughout; and, most importantly,The failure of the Complainant to mention that he had purposely and intentionally struck his own head against the concrete wall in his cell.As a result of these specific obstructive actions by the Complainant, which he failed to mention in his statement to theSIUeither because he did not recall them due to his state of intoxication, or he purposely omitted them in order to place himself in a better light, or for some other unknown purpose, I find that I am unable to place any reliance on the evidence of the Complainant, except where it is specifically confirmed by some other evidence.  In coming to my conclusion with respect to the facts in this matter, I find that the video evidence supports the evidence of the various police officers in every respect, and as such I have made my findings of fact based primarily on the video evidence, but also on the evidence of the police witnesses, as their version of events is confirmed by the video evidence.That, however, does not end the matter.  Since there is no dispute that the Complainant was seriously injured during his interaction with theSO, an assessment is still required to determine whether or not the actions of theSO, in subduing the Complainant, amounted to an excessive use of force in the circumstances thereby vitiating his protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25 (1) of theCriminal Code.As such, the question to be determined is whether taking the Complainant to the floor, following his attempts to push theSOaway, and then to strike him, and the delivery of a number of blows to the Complainant, when he continued to fight, was justified in the circumstances or if it amounted to an excessive use of force.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order for theSOto qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s arrest, it is clear from the information in the 911 calls that the Complainant was not only being disruptive and frightening the occupants of the home from which the 911 caller made her call, but that he was also in breach of his conditions of release, wherein he had been ordered to stay 150 metres away from the residence of his former girlfriend. As such, the police were acting in the execution of a lawful duty when they arrested the Complainant for breaching the conditions of his release, contrary to s. 145 (3) of theCriminal Code.  As long as the officers used no more force than was necessary and reasonable in the circumstances, therefore, their actions are protected from prosecution pursuant to s. 25.It is clear on all of the evidence, and as seen on theCCTVfootage, that the Complainant was being resistant and combative with theSO, and that he was physically resisting the officer, as a result of which theSOimmediately reacted to take the Complainant to the floor and to regain control over him.  While the Complainant was actively fighting theSO, both men then fell to the floor, which may have been responsible for the injury to the Complainant’s face.  While the video reveals the Complainant continuing to actively struggle and fight, theSOis then seen to bring his arm back and strike the Complainant; with theSOindicating that he used his right fist to strike the Complainant in the face once, near his mouth, following which he then delivered two further blows using his right forearm to strike the Complainant in the face with the outer part of his arm, which he described more as a “press to the face” than a strike. TheCCTVfootage appears quite consistent with this description of events and confirms the evidence of theSO. On this basis, I conclude that the actions of theSO, both in taking the Complainant down to the floor in a head lock and in delivering the three blows to the Complainant, who continued to actively fight and resist, even after all three of the police officers were holding him down, were both reasonable and justified in the circumstances, bringing theSOunder the protection of s. 25.In concluding that the actions of theSOdo not amount to an unnecessary or excessive use of force, I am mindful of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada as set out inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.On all of the evidence, it is clear that had the Complainant not resisted and not been combative with theSO, no force would have been required to search him and then lodge him in the cells.[1]As such, while I find that the Complainant’s serious injury was sustained during his struggle with theSO, and as a result of the efforts of theSOto regain control over the Complainant, the evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSO, or any of the officers involved with the Complainant, acted outside ofthe parameters of theCriminal Code.  As such, as I lack the necessary grounds for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	January 28, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=214
,Ontario Provincial Police,Toronto,Ontario,Emergency responders soon arrived extricated the Complainant from his pickup truck and took him to hospital where he was diagnosed and treated for a number of fractures,"The offence that arises for consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to the section of theCriminal Codethen in effect, namely, section 249(3) (presently, section 320.13(2)).  The offence is predicated in part on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances.  It is clear that theSOwas speeding at the time of the accident.  Data downloaded from his vehicle indicates that the officer had reached a speed of 129 km/h several seconds before the collision.  While police vehicles being used in the lawful performance of a police officer’s duty are authorized to exceed the speed limit pursuant to section 128(13)(b) of theHighway Traffic Act, an officer must always have due regard for public safety considerations.  In this case, there does not appear to have existed any pressing reason for the officer to be traveling as fast as he was.  TheSOought to have appreciated the potential for slippery road conditions and adjusted his speed accordingly.  That said, there is no evidence that the officer was otherwise imperiling traffic around him by the manner of his driving.  Moreover, it is important to note that theSO’s speed does not appear to have been grossly disproportionate to the speed of traffic around him – in the area of 100 to 115 km/h on the evidence of a number of motorists interviewed by theSIU(including the Complainant).  Weighed in the balance, I am not satisfied on reasonable grounds that the officer’s indiscretion involving his speed is enough to render his conduct a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances.

,Ontario Provincial Police,Armour,Ontario,Overall features of the wound in conjunction with the case history are consistent with a self-inflicted injury”;\n“A patterned bruise on right lateral cheek was very likely the result of a firearm muzzle being pushed against the skin” and\n“A lacerated well-defined circular bruise on the left elbow was consistent with an ARWEN projectile injury,"It is apparent on the record gathered by theSIUthat theOPPofficers involved in the sequence of events ending in the Complainant’s death conducted themselves lawfully at all times.  They were duty bound to respond when contacted by the Complainant’s family; the Complainant was heavily armed, emotionally unstable, and a clear and present danger to himself and those around him.  They did so quickly and professionally.  LocalOPPofficers were the first to arrive.  They set up a perimeter around the home to contain the threat and took steps to ensure that nearby residents were successfully evacuated.  At great risk to themselves,WO#6 andWO#8 decided to engage the Complainant at close proximity with the aim of de-escalating the situation.  Despite their repeated appeals, the Complainant remained steadfast and refused to surrender his firearms.  On the contrary, he gave the officers increasing indication that he was bent on provoking a confrontation that would see him shot and killed by police.  At the mention of armour-piercing bullets and sensing the Complainant’s growing resolve, the officers made the decision to retreat from the area as soon as an opportunity presented itself.  They were wise, in my view, in so doing.  A trainedOPPnegotiator was brought in and was able to speak with the Complainant by phone, but unable to convince him to stand down.ERTofficers soon arrived and took over containment of the scene, followed byTRUteam members.  With the tactical resources at their disposal,TRUofficers deployed a couple of armoured-vehicles to approach the scene.  From within one of these vehicles, the officers continued their efforts at communication with the Complainant.  During this time, attempts were made to contact a forensic psychiatrist to assist in guiding the police response.  Regrettably, he could not be reached in time.  TheTRUteam also considered the use of a properly trained canine unit, but, again, none were readily available to respond.  In the end, as the Complainant’s behaviour escalated to the point of pointing his handgun at his head, the decision was made to shoot him with anARWEN– a less lethal weapon designed to temporarily disable.  In making the decision, the officers considered but dismissed the possibility of using aCEW, which was also available to them, given the windy conditions at the time and the winter jacket that the Complainant was wearing that could well impede the proper penetration of the weapon’s probes.  While it is unfortunate that theARWENdid not have the desired effect, I am unable to find any fault with the decision to use it.  On the contrary, I am satisfied that it was a reasonable use of force in all the circumstances.  The Complainant had given the officers every indication that he was about to shoot himself, and the officers were justified in using theARWENin an effort to prevent that from happening.In short, the evidence establishes that theOPPofficers, includingSO#2, with overall command of the operation, andSO#1, who discharged theARWEN, acted reasonably throughout the standoff with the Complainant.  Consequently, I am satisfied there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges against any of the officers in relation to the Complainant’s self-inflicted death, and the file is closed.Date:	May 15, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=320
,Hamilton Police Service,Caledon,Ontario,Following the post-mortem examination the attending pathologist determined the immediate cause of death was a ‘penetrating distance indeterminate range 1 gunshot wound of the right chest,"As a result, the firstHPSunit was dispatched to the area of the Ford Dealership on Upper James Street in the City of Hamilton at 3:37:06 p.m., with several other units being dispatched shortly thereafter.When the call taker cross-referenced the second and third 911 calls and realized that they were connected with the earlier 911 call at 11:55 a.m., she was able to put the name of the Complainant to the subsequent calls and determined the location of the caller as being at the Complainant’s address, and the dispatched units were re-routed from the Ford dealership to that address.A call back to the final number from which the Complainant had called, put the call taker in touch with civilian witness (CW) #4, who then handed the phone over to the Complainant, who then spoke with the call taker.  When the call taker requested further information about the gunman, the Complainant provided a description of a black 19-year-old male, and then again terminated the call.The Complainant was described by those who knew him as not suffering from any major mental illness.  On the morning of April 3, 2018, however, the Complainant appeared to be paranoid and panicky, believing that he and his family had to urgently move from their home or they would be killed.  At 7:47 a.m., the Complainant told his girlfriend, via text message, “Fuck, I want to die.”  When asked why, he indicated that he did not even know but that his life was bad.Witness officer (WO) #2, anHPSofficer who was in plain clothes and operating an unmarked EquinoxSUVpolice vehicle, was parked in front of the Metro grocery store at 751 Upper James Street at 3:35 p.m., monitoring his police radio, when he heard a weapons call regarding a man with a gun; the report indicated that the call had come from a complainant on Caledon Avenue, not far from whereWO#2 was situated at that time.WO#2 decided to drive by the area to investigate, as he would not be immediately identifiable as a police officer and might be able to see something.WO#2 drove southbound on Caledon Avenue and observed a markedHPScruiser with its emergency lights on driving towards him and then pull over to the east side of Caledon Avenue and subsequently entered a driveway on Caledon Avenue.WO#2 then pulled his vehicle over to the west curb of Caledon Avenue, lowered his window, and observed two men standing in the driveway of a residence on Caledon Avenue.CW#4, in his statement toSIUinvestigators, indicated that the Complainant, a neighbour, had come to his home at about 3:30 p.m. on April 3, 2018, requesting to use his telephone as the Complainant’s telephone was ‘dead’.  The Complainant had toldCW#4 that he needed to call the police as someone wanted to shoot him.CW#4 described the Complainant as shaken or scared and he provided his cell phone to the Complainant, who then called 911.CW#4 was told by the Complainant that a man was in the next parking lot near the car dealership; during the conversation, the Complainant kept scanning the area. At 3:42 p.m., theHPScalledCW#4’s cell phone and he handed it over to the Complainant.CW#4 then observed an EquinoxSUVmotor vehicle driving southbound on Caledon Avenue and stop across the street from their location; a markedHPSpolice cruiser then pulled up into the second driveway andCW#4 retrieved his phone and told the Complainant that the police had arrived.  The Complainant then walked back to his own residence.WO#1, the first officer to arrive at the address, observed two men standing in a driveway waving at him and he drove his cruiser into the driveway, rolled down his window, and asked them if they had called the police.CW#4 responded and stated that his neighbour, the Complainant, had come to the door and that he had called the police on his behalf.WO#1 then asked the second man if he had the same name as had been provided in the 911 call, and the Complainant agreed that he did.WO#1 made enquiries as to the location of the ‘guy with the gun’, but the Complainant did not respond.WO#1 then observed the arrival ofWO#2’s EquinoxSUVon the opposite side of the street, and the Complainant indicated that that was the guy with the gun.WO#1 told the Complainant that he would go over and check it out.  AsWO#1 neared the Equinox, he saw that the driver was holding a police radio and he correctly inferred that he was a police officer.WO#2, from where he was seated in his unmarked police vehicle, observedWO#1 and the Complainant looking at him, and then sawWO#1 walk toward him, leaving the Complainant behind.WO#2 then exited his vehicle asWO#1 approached, and lifted his coat to reveal his police badge;WO#2 said that he may have also inadvertently revealed his firearm in doing so.WO#2 then askedWO#1 what was going on, andWO#1 told him that the Complainant had identified him,WO#2, as the man with the gun.WO#2 responded that it was not him, as he had arrived just now, for the purpose of assisting the patrol units.WO#1 then returned to the Complainant, andWO#2 returned to sit in his vehicle.WO#1 told the Complainant thatWO#2 was a police officer and not the man with the gun.  While the Complainant did not initially respond, afterWO#1 repeated himself, the Complainant then indicated, in a low whispered voice, that the ‘Bloods’ were after him, indicating that he was referring to the ‘Bloods’ street gang.  Shortly thereafter,SO#1 arrived, followed moments later byWO#4,WO#3, andSO#2.A civilian witness,CW#2, observed two markedHPScruisers in the townhouse complex, as well as a dark-colouredSUVon the west side of Caledon Avenue.  Two to three minutes later,CW#2 observed the Complainant running from a laneway on Caledon Avenue towards theSUV.  Upon the Complainant’s arrival atWO#2’sSUV,CW#2 observed him to put his hand on the window frame and then raise his right hand, in which he was holding a knife, which she described as being directed towardWO#2, who was seated inside theSUV;WO#2 then rolled up his window.CW#2 indicated that she saw the Complainant holding the knife at shoulder height near the head ofWO#2 and she thought thatWO#2 was going to be killed.CW#5, another civilian witness, was driving his van in the area when he observed the four police officers on Caledon Avenue, three of whom were in uniform (WO#4,WO#3, andSO#2), while the fourth,SO#1, was wearing a jacket over his uniform; this jacket was described by other witnesses as being yellow in colour.  SinceCW#5 did not know what was happening, and as he had his children in the van with him, he stopped his van in the middle of Caledon Avenue and suddenly observed the Complainant appear at the door ofWO#2’s Equinox, leaning partially down and into the open window of theSUV.CW#5 then heard the police officers shouting at the Complainant and the Complainant quickly ran away.CW#5 observed that the Complainant had an object in his right hand.Thirteen-year-oldCW#3, who was seated inside her father’s van, saw the Complainant start to run towardWO#2’s Equinox.  When the Complainant arrived at the Equinox,CW#3 observed him to briefly try the driver’s door and she saw that he had a knife in his right hand.CW#3 observed the Complainant gesture, in a single downward stabbing motion, toward the driver’s window of the Equinox, following which he ran towards their van;CW#3 saw that the police officers were running after the Complainant at that time.CW#3 observed that three of the four police officers pursuing the Complainant had either their pistols or theirCEWs drawn, while the fourth police officer was trying to remove something from his belt.CW#3 saw the Complainant stop in the middle of the road, to her right, and the police officers also stopped.  The Complainant then ran at the police officers, who were surrounding him in a semi-circle.  All four police officers had their weapons drawn, and their arms extended at chest level.CW#3 observed the Complainant approach one of the police officers and position the knife in front of him, following which he took a step or two and lunged at the police officer, as if to stab him in the chest.CW#3 feared that the officer was going to be seriously hurt or killed when she saw the knife blade come within inches of the police officer.  Almost immediately,CW#3 saw a flash of light come from an object being held by another police officer, which she thought looked like a gun being fired.CW#3 saw the Complainant take a step to his right and then fall to the ground; as he fell,CW#3 saw the knife that the Complainant had been holding also fall to the ground and another officer approached and stood on it.  The female officer,WO#4, then ran to the police cruiser and removed a red bag, returning to where the Complainant was lying on the ground.CW#2, who had moved from her home to that of a neighbour, observed a police officer with the Complainant, face to face, grab a hold of the Complainant’s upper arms, following which the Complainant broke free and ran into the street while holding a knife in his hand.  A second police officer, (WO#1, based on the evidence of other witnesses) was seen andCW#2 could hear the officers saying something, but could not make out the words.CW#2 observed the Complainant about two centimetres from the police officer when the Complainant grabbed the front of the officer’s bullet proof vest and swung his knife over his head as if to stab the officer.CW#2 thought that the officer was going to be stabbed.CW#2 then saw three or four uniformed police officers, with weapons drawn and pointed at the Complainant, run toward him and surround him.CW#2 observed one of the police officers deploy hisCEWat the Complainant, but it missed its mark and the wires fell into a puddle of water.  Shortly thereafter, that same police officer (WO#1), dropped hisCEWand reached for his pistol.  Almost immediately following theCEWdeployment,CW#2 heard a gunshot fired, but he did not see who discharged the firearm.  The Complainant then stumbled east and after a brief pause of about 20 seconds, she heard two more gunshots, and the Complainant fell to the ground.CW#5 observed the Complainant cross to the east side of the street with something held in his hand.CW#5 then saw the police officers appear to surround the Complainant, with one officer (WO#1) standing with a weapon in his hand; he described the officer as being beyond arm’s reach of the Complainant.  The Complainant then made a thrusting motion toward the police officer andWO#1 discharged hisCEWat the Complainant.CW#5 saw an electric charge or light emitted by theCEWand then saw that the Complainant had been hit, but he remained standing.CW#5 then heard the sound of gunfire and saw the Complainant collapse to the ground. He made note of the time on his car clock as being 3:49 p.m.CW#4 saw the Complainant run atWO#2, in his Equinox, shouting, “You want to kill me?  You want me dead?”  Following which he observed the police officers draw their firearms and he heard aCEWbeing deployed.CW#4 saw that the wires from theCEWreached the middle of Caledon Avenue.  The Complainant then ran toward Caledon Avenue, with the police officers chasing him in a “U” formation.  The Complainant then turned quickly with something in his hand, and ran at a police officer standing in the street; as the Complainant ran at the officer, he made four or five chopping motions with his right hand.CW#4 heard the police officers yelling at the Complainant, to which the Complainant again yelled, “You want to kill me?  You want to me to die?”CW#4 saw the Complainant then come within three feet ofWO#1, at which point he heard four or five gunshots and saw the Complainant walk to the east curb and then collapse on the grass.I note that all witnesses, with the exception ofCW#2, described a series of gunshots in rapid succession, with no pause between, on which basis I find thatCW#2 was mistaken about there being a 20 second pause between gunshots and find instead that there was no delay between gunshots, with all occurring rapidly and one after the other, or simultaneously.I additionally note thatCW#2’s observation that the Complainant came within about two centimetres of a police officer when he grabbed the front of the officer’s bullet proof vest and swung his knife over his head as if to stab the officer, is inconsistent with the evidence of all of the other witnesses in its timing, as she has this as occurring prior toWO#1 deploying hisCEW, while all other witnesses have it as occurring afterWO#1 deployed hisCEWand immediately prior to the Complainant being shot.According toSO#1, he was wearing a yellow police issue fluorescent jacket on April 3, 2018; this accords with the evidence of the other police witnesses, as well as the otherCWs.  WhenSO#1 arrived on Caledon Avenue, he saw thatWO#1‘s police cruiser was already present, as wasWO#2’s unmarkedSUV, withWO#2 sitting inside.SO#1 pulled over, exited his police cruiser, and spoke withWO#1 and then to the Complainant.SO#1 asked the Complainant why he had called police and what the suspect looked like, but the Complainant indicated that he did not know.  When asked if the suspect was black or white, the Complainant again indicated that he did not know.  The Complainant then pointed to the EquinoxSUVand stated, “I think he was with that guy.”SO#1 then took a couple of steps toward the Equinox, at which point he recognizedWO#2 as a police officer, and he returned to the Complainant without speaking toWO#2.  At that point,SO#1 began to suspect that the Complainant may have some mental health issues, or was emotionally disturbed, but not to such a degree that he had grounds to apprehend him under theMental Health Act(MHA).[8]Consequently,SO#1 began to suspect that the report by the Complainant of a man with a gun was not genuine and he broadcast over the radio for other units to slow down.  This is confirmed by the radio transmission at 3:45:36 p.m. whereinSO#1 is recorded as saying, “Everyone can slow down.  Everyone is 10-4.  Might beMHA.”WO#4,SO#2, andWO#3 arrived at the address almost immediately thereafter.As a result of there having been two separate 911 calls  reporting a gun man,SO#1 felt it prudent to try and track down the second caller or any possible witnesses to the alleged incident, and he walked away from the Complainant in order to do so.SO#1 then radioed in requesting if it was possible that the two 911 calls were made by the same caller, or if there were indeed two callers.This is again confirmed by the communications recording whereinSO#1 is heard to call in moments later and ask, “Any chance both calls came from the same person?”  WhileSO#1 waited for a response back from the dispatcher, he had his back turned to the Complainant.  He then heard yelling and screaming and turned to see the Complainant running towardsWO#2’sSUV.  When the Complainant neared theSUV,SO#1 saw the coil of wires from aCEWcoming from his left towards the Complainant, and he heard someone yell, “Knife!”WO#2, from inside hisSUV, heard a police officer over the radio indicating that everything was okay and no more units were required on the call.  Approximately one minute later,WO#2 suddenly heard someone yell, “Drop the knife!” and saw the Complainant running at his vehicle with a knife in his right hand, and his arm extended out in front of him.WO#2, whose access to his firearm was restricted because of his coat, could not get to his firearm quickly enough, so he closed his window and locked his doors, following which the Complainant suddenly stopped running.WO#2 indicated that he feared for his life from the Complainant, at that point, and had he been able to access his firearm, he would have done so in order to defend himself.WO#2 continued to hear police officers behind the Complainant yelling at him to drop the knife and he looked out his window and saw two or three uniformed officers chasing after the Complainant.WO#2 then called in to the dispatcher and reported that the Complainant had a knife and that officers were in a foot pursuit.This evidence is confirmed by the police transmissions recording, wherein an unknown police officer is recorded as calling in, “He’s holding a knife, he’s holding a knife!”,  immediately followed by a transmission fromWO#2, in which he states, “Yeah, he’s pulled a knife and they are on foot pursuit now.”WO#2 then reached behind him in his police vehicle for his tactical vest, at which time he heard the crackling sounds of aCEWand he looked into his side-view mirror and saw the Complainant standing some 15 to 20 metres north of his Equinox; since the Complainant was still standing,WO#2 surmised that theCEWmust not have been effective.WO#2 then observed the Complainant face east with the knife extended in front of him and that the police officers had created a semi-circle around the Complainant and were yelling at him to drop the knife.WO#2 then saw the Complainant charge at a police officer, who was unknown to him, standing a few feet away and it appeared toWO#2 that the knife was going to make contact with the officer.  He then immediately heard three or four gunshots in rapid succession and the Complainant stopped, took a step or two, and then fell to the ground.  At that point,WO#2 reported over his police radio, “Shots fired, subject down!” and asked theEMSto attend.This is confirmed by the radio transmission recording whereinWO#2 is heard to report, 11 seconds after he had reported that the Complainant had a knife and the officers were in foot pursuit, “Shots fired, shots fired! We are going to need an ambulance here,” to which the dispatcher responds, “Shots fired.  Require an ambulance,” andWO#2 adds, “Looks like the subject is down, all the officers look to be okay.”The Police ResponseWhile the police officers were asking the Complainant for more information about the alleged gunman,WO#1 observed the Complainant to walk into the middle of the street, where he reached into his back pant pocket and pulled out a knife. The Complainant then began to pace and stare at the police officers, suddenly shouting out, “Shoot me! Shoot me!”, as he held the knife above his head.  The Complainant then walked in the direction ofWO#2’sSUV, swinging his knife at theSUVas he neared, whileWO#2 closed his window.  At that point,WO#1 drew hisCEWand deployed it at the Complainant’s back, but it appeared to have no effect and the Complainant then walked away.Upon the arrival ofSO#2 and his partner,WO#3, at the townhouse complex,SO#2 saw the Complainant standing behindSO#1,WO#4, andWO#1, who had their backs to the Complainant.  As soon asSO#2 exited his cruiser, he observed the Complainant raise a knife, which he was holding in his right hand, over his head.  At that point,SO#2 thought that the Complainant was going to stabSO#1 in the back or neck and he immediately yelled, “Knife! Knife! Knife!” to warn the other officers.  The Complainant then ran toWO#2’s Equinox, whileSO#2 yelled toWO#2 to put up his window.SO#2 feared that the Complainant was going to stabWO#2, butWO#2 managed to get his window closed.  From a distance of approximately 50 feet,SO#2 observed the Complainant to either stab or punch the driver’s door window ofWO#2’s vehicle.WhenSO#2 observed that other officers had theirCEWs drawn, that the Complainant was now moving towardWO#1 with the knife still in his right hand and over his head, and that the Complainant had closed the distance between himself andWO#1 to approximately ten feet, he decided that he should have a lethal use of force option available in the event that theCEWs were not effective in stopping the Complainant.WO#1 then removed the expended cartridge in hisCEWand replaced it with a new one, while following the Complainant from the opposite side of the street.  WhenWO#1 saw the Complainant stop at a nearby Pontiac motor vehicle, he observed the Complainant suddenly charge at him (WO#1) with the knife raised and held in his right hand.WO#1 then deployed hisCEWa second time and, despite the probes appearing to make contact with the Complainant, it again had no effect on the Complainant, who continued to charge atWO#1.SO#1 had his back turned to the Complainant while he waited to hear back from the dispatcher about the origin of the two 911 calls alleging a gunman, when he heard police officers shouting at the Complainant and was shocked at how the situation had escalated.  While he had found in speaking to the Complainant that his responses were strange, he had not considered the Complainant as being a danger or that anyone’s safety was at risk.SO#1 then heard the cocking ofCEWs and saw the Complainant running with the knife in his hand, held up high by the right side of his head with the blade pointed downward.SO#1 observed that the Complainant was running in the direction of a nearby school and he attempted to broadcast over the radio that the Complainant was armed with a knife, but he couldn’t get through; shortly thereafter, he heardWO#2 broadcast the same information over the radio.WhileSO#1 was running north on the east side of the street, he observedWO#1 ahead of him running in the same direction, withWO#4,SO#2, andWO#3 following him.  When the Complainant got to the front of a line of parked cars, he wheeled around and ran onto the roadway towardWO#1, withWO#1 trying to retreat away from the Complainant, while trying to insert a cartridge into hisCEW.  The Complainant was yelling and screaming, while charging atWO#1 with the knife in his right hand above his head.SO#2 heard the clicking sound of aCEWand saw the wires, but could not see which police officer had deployed it, and immediately observed that the deployment had been ineffective.SO#2 described the Complainant as being fixated onWO#1, as he continued to close the distance between them to about three feet.As the Complainant continued to charge atWO#1,WO#1 retreated backwards to create distance between himself and the Complainant andWO#1 frankly indicated that he feared for his life at that moment, and he therefore tried to access his firearm.  While he was trying to draw his firearm, however, the Complainant managed to come within one foot ofWO#1 andWO#1 felt him make contact with his right arm.WO#1 then saw the knife above the Complainant’s head, whereupon he also immediately heard four or five gunshots coming from his left side.WO#1 then stepped back as the Complainant fell to the ground.SO#1 observedWO#1 to look very scared andSO#1 was afraid that the Complainant was only moments away from driving the knife intoWO#1’s neck and killing him, or causing him serious bodily harm.SO#1 went to reach for hisCEWand then looked around and saw that some of the other police officers already had theirCEWs in hand, and he felt he had to draw his pistol, which he then pointed at the Complainant.As the Complainant closed the distance between himself andWO#1,SO#1 looked down the barrel of his pistol and found thatWO#4 was in his line of fire.  As a result, he took a step to his left and shouted, “Police, don’t move!”SO#1 observed that the Complainant was very close toWO#1 at that point, but he was confident that if he discharged his firearm, he would not strikeWO#1.SO#1 observed the Complainant, who was at that point within three feet ofWO#1, almost place his left hand onWO#1, at which pointSO#1 discharged his firearm.SO#1 could not say how often he fired, but indicated that he did so until the threat was over.  The Complainant then dropped to the ground and tried to get back up, whereuponSO#1 discharged his last shot.SO#2 feared that the Complainant was going to stabWO#1 and, as both theCEWand verbal commands to the Complainant to drop the knife had been ineffective,SO#2 determined that he had no other choice but to resort to lethal force.SO#2 then discharged his firearm and fired two to four shots at the Complainant, who remained standing.  The Complainant then stumbled pastWO#1, tripped over the curb, and fell to the ground. WhileSO#2 was discharging his firearm, he was aware that another firearm was being simultaneously discharged from his right side, which he assumed was coming fromSO#1.  Once on the ground,SO#2 saw that the Complainant, while not getting up, still had the knife in his hand and he removed it and placed it out of reach.WO#3, who observed the Complainant closing the distance between himself andWO#1, with his chest making contact withWO#1’s arm, whileWO#1 was trying to retreat, saw the Complainant holding the knife over his head as if to stabWO#1 in the head.WO#3, who had his firearm drawn, was prepared to shoot the Complainant in fear ofWO#1’s life, butWO#1 was in his line of fire and he therefore was unable to do so.  Within one to two seconds of the Complainant making contact withWO#1’s arm,WO#3 heard two shots in succession fired from his right side; when he looked in that direction, after the Complainant had fallen, he sawSO#1 with his pistol still pointed at the Complainant and, from the shocked look on his face, he inferred that it wasSO#1 who had discharged his firearm.WhileWO#3 did not see anyone else with their firearm drawn,SO#2 later told him that he had shot the Complainant.LikeWO#1,WO#4 had also drawn herCEW, which she first attempted to deploy when the Complainant was running inWO#1’s direction, but herCEWwas not activated and it was unable to deploy.  AfterWO#1 had deployed hisCEWthe second time,WO#4 then turned on herCEWand discharged it at the Complainant as he ran past her, while she simultaneously heard three quick pops, which she quickly realized were gunshots coming from the direction of whereSO#1 was standing holding his gun.WO#4 observed a probe for aCEWin the back of the Complainant’s calf and she continued to keep her finger on the trigger of herCEWuntil the Complainant stopped running, following which he dropped the knife in his hand.WO#4 was also later told bySO#2 that he had discharged his firearm and that he had done so because the Complainant had tried to stabWO#1.On all of the evidence, both from civilian witnesses and police officers, then, there is no disagreement that the Complainant was armed with a knife and that he initially charged atWO#2 with that knife.  That attack was thwarted byWO#2 when he closed his window and locked his doors.  It is important to note, however, thatWO#2 was clear that he feared for his life when the Complainant was running at him with the knife and, had he been able to access his firearm, he would have used it to defend himself.LikeWO#2, civilian witnessCW#2 also feared that the Complainant was going to killWO#2 when she saw him holding the knife at shoulder height near the head ofWO#2.Thereafter, despite numerous demands by the police for the Complainant to drop the knife and stop, and despite three ineffective deployments of aCEW(two byWO#1 and one byWO#4), the Complainant, apparently fixated onWO#1, charged atWO#1 while holding the knife over his head, blade forward and down.WO#1, in turn, attempted to retreat and to put some distance between himself and the Complainant, but was unable to do so with the Complainant coming into contact with his body.  LikeWO#2,WO#1 indicated that he feared for his life and he was attempting to draw his firearm, but was unable to do so.WO#3, who indicated that he too feared for the life ofWO#1 and thought that the Complainant was going to stabWO#1 in the head, was successful in drawing his firearm and was of the view that lethal force was called for in order to save the life ofWO#1, but he did not discharge his firearm becauseWO#1 was between himself and the Complainant.SO#1 indicated that he feared that the Complainant was only moments away from driving his knife into the neck ofWO#1, and causing him serious bodily harm, if not death, as a result of which he discharged his firearm when the Complainant was in very close proximity toWO#1, but he was confident that he could do so without strikingWO#1.SO#2 drew his firearm, when he observed other officers with theirCEWs drawn, out of an abundance of caution in case theCEWs were not effective.SO#2 indicated that after repeated instructions to drop the knife were ignored by the Complainant, and there had been three ineffective deployments ofCEWs, he surmised that his only option was to resort to a lethal use of force.  When the Complainant then closed the distance between himself andWO#1 to within three feet, andSO#2 feared that the Complainant was going to successfully stabWO#1, he too discharged his firearm.In addition to the commonly held fear by the four police officers present thatWO#1’s life was in danger from the Complainant, I note that at least two of the civilian witnesses voiced that same fear, withCW#3 indicating that she feared that the officer was going to be seriously hurt or killed when she saw the knife blade come within inches him, andCW#2 indicating that she thought that the officer was going to be stabbed.The Law and AnalysisThe question that remains to be answered, then, on the facts as I have found them, is whether or notSO#1 andSO#2 were justified in using lethal force against the Complainant, or whether the discharging of their firearms at the Complainant amounted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances and provides reasonable grounds for the laying of criminal charges against both police officers for causing the death of the Complainant.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Codeof Canada, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Further, pursuant to subsection 3:(3)  … a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.As such, in order for the two subject officers to qualify for protection from prosecution under section 25, it must be established that they were in the execution of a lawful duty, that they were acting on reasonable grounds, and that they used no more force than was necessary in the circumstances.  Furthermore, pursuant to subsection 3, since death was caused, it must also be established that both subject officers discharged their firearms believing on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in order to preserve themselves, or others, specificallyWO#1, from death or grievous bodily harm.Turning first to the lawfulness of the attempted apprehension of the Complainant, it is clear from the observations of all witnesses, both civilian and police, that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was in possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88 of theCriminal Code, in that he brandished that weapon and charged atWO#2 with what appeared to be an obvious intention to do him harm.  As such, I am satisfied that the pursuit and apprehension of the Complainant was legally justified in the circumstances.With respect to the other requirements pursuant to s.25(1) and (3), I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR v Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]The court describes the test required under s.25 as follows:Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances. That is not the end of the matter. Section 25(3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force, i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily harm. The officer's belief must be objectively reasonable. This means that the use of force under s. 25(3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis (Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).The decision of Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice inChartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada above, sets out other relevant provisions of theCriminal Codeto be considered, as follows:27. 	Use of force to prevent commission of offence - Everyone is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary(a)	to prevent the commission of an offence(i) for which, if it were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and(ii) that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone, or(b)	to prevent anything being done that, on reasonable grounds, he believes would, if it were done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).This Section, therefore, authorizes the use of force to prevent the commission of certain offenses. “Everyone"" would include a police officer. The force must not be more than that which is reasonably necessary. Therefore, an objective test is called for. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Scopelliti (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 held that the use of deadly force can be justified only in either cases of self-defence or in preventing the commission of a crime likely to cause immediate and serious injury.34(1) 	Self-defence against unprovoked assault - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him to defend himself (or another person)(2)	Extent of justification - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified if(a)	he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and(b)	he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.In order to rely on the defence under subsection (2) of Section 34, a police officer would have to demonstrate that he/she was unlawfully assaulted and caused death or grievous bodily harm to the assaulter in repelling the assault. The police officer must demonstrate that he or she reasonably apprehended that death or grievous bodily harm would result to him or her and that he or she, again on reasonable grounds, believed that he/she could not otherwise preserve himself/herself from death or grievous bodily harm. Again, the use of the term reasonable requires the application of an objective test.The court also sets out a number of other legal principles gleaned from the legal precedents cited, including the following:(h) 	Whichever section of theCriminal Codeis used to assess the actions of the police, the Court must consider the level of force that was necessary in light of the circumstances surrounding the event.(i) 	""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". The same applies to the use of force in making an arrest or preventing an escape. Like the driver of a vehicle facing a sudden emergency, the policeman ""cannot be held to a standard of conduct which one sitting in the calmness of a court room later might determine was the best course."" (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).(j) 	Police officers perform an essential function in sometimes difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. The police must not be unduly hampered in the performance of that duty. They must frequently act hurriedly and react to sudden emergencies. Their actions must therefore be considered in the light of the circumstances.(k) 	""It is both unreasonable and unrealistic to impose an obligation on the police to employ only the least amount of force which might successfully achieve their objective. To do so would result in unnecessary danger to themselves and others. They are justified and exempt from liability in these situations if they use no more force than is necessary, having regard to their reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers in which they find themselves"" (Levesque v. Zanibbi et al.).On the basis of the foregoing principles of law then, I must determine:(1)	WhetherSO#1 andSO#2 subjectively believed thatWO#1 was at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant at the time that they discharged their firearms; and,(2)	Whether that belief was objectively reasonable, or, in other words, whether their actions would be considered reasonable by an objective bystander who had all of the information available to them thatSO#1 andSO#2 had at the time that they discharged their firearms.With respect to the first of these criteria, it is clear from the statements ofSO#1 andSO#2 that they each believed thatWO#1 was at risk of death or grievous bodily harm at the time that they discharged their firearms.  They each based that belief on their observations at the time that the Complainant was quickly advancing onWO#1 with a knife in hand, that the Complainant refused either to stop or to drop his weapon when repeatedly directed by officers to do so, and that the three previous deployments of aCEWhad been ineffective, leaving only one option by which to effectively stop the Complainant attackingWO#1, that being the resort to lethal force.On all of the information that each ofSO#1 andSO#2 had in their possession at the time that they shot and killed the Complainant, I find that they each, subjectively, had reasonable grounds to believe that the life ofWO#1 was at risk from the Complainant and that their observations of the Complainant’s actions would have reasonably caused each officer to believe thatWO#1 was at imminent risk of being seriously injured, if not killed, by the Complainant.In considering the reasonableness of the actions of both officers in discharging their firearms and whether or not they considered the use of less lethal use of force options before resorting to those firearms, I note that each officer considered that other officers had theirCEWs drawn and that aCEWhad been ineffectively deployed on at least one occasion, that the Complainant had not heeded any directions to drop his knife, and that the Complainant had already closed the gap between himself andWO#1 and a knife attack was imminent.  With each ofWO#1 andWO#4 already having resorted to the only other less lethal use of force options available to stop the Complainant, each of which had proven ineffective, the only remaining option at the disposal of these officers was to resort to their firearms.  On that basis, it is clear that each ofSO#1 andSO#2, in the brief seconds afterWO#1 had deployed hisCEWfor the second time, and while the Complainant was quickly advancing uponWO#1 with a deadly weapon, appear to have considered all of their available options before discharging their firearms.With respect to whether or not there were objectively reasonable grounds to believe that the life ofWO#1 was at risk, one need only refer to the evidence of:CW#3, who indicated that she feared thatWO#1 was going to be seriously hurt or killed when she saw the Complainant bring the knife blade within inches of him;CW#2, who indicated that she thought that the officer was going to be stabbed by the Complainant;WO#3, who indicated that he too feared for the life ofWO#1 and thought that the Complainant was going to stabWO#1 in the head; and finally,WO#1, who frankly indicated that he feared for his life when the Complainant closed the gap between them while holding the knife above his head.Finally, I note that in addition to the beliefs ofSO#1 andSO#2 that there was a need to resort to a lethal use of force in order to save the life ofWO#1, each ofWO#2,WO#3, andWO#1 equally believed that a resort to a lethal use of force was the only option left open to them, and that they each would have resorted to that option, but for various reasons, each of these three officers was either unable to access their firearm, or unable to take a shot without endangering others.The law relating to the use of force intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm establishes that when one believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary in order to defend another from death or grievous bodily harm, then one is justified in using lethal force to stop that threat. Having reviewed the evidence, I find in all the circumstances that bothSO#1 andSO#2 reasonably believed that the life ofWO#1 was in danger from the Complainant and their actions, in firing upon the Complainant, were therefore justified.  I find that it would have been foolish and reckless for either of these officers to risk the life of their colleague by waiting for the Complainant, who had knife in hand, was rapidly closing the gap between himself andWO#1, and had the knife poised above his head as if to stabWO#1 in the neck, to actually stabWO#1, thereby puttingWO#1 at immediate risk of serious injury or death.  I further find that that risk was not one that any of the officers ought to have had to take when faced with a knife yielding man and the imminent death or serious bodily harm of one of their fellow officers.I find, therefore, on this record, that the shots that were fired by bothSO#1 andSO#2, one of which struck and killed the Complainant, were justified pursuant to ss. 25 (1) and (3) of theCriminal Codeand that each officer, in preservingWO#1 from death or grievous bodily harm at the hands of the Complainant, used no more force than was necessary to affect their lawful purpose.  As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions resorted to by these two officers, despite the tragic loss of life, fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and none shall issue.Date:	March 6, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=259

,Greater Sudbury Police Service,Greater Sudbury,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment Complainant 2 attended the hospital where a “metallic foreign body” was located 14 cms beneath the skin’s surface on his left tibia shinbone no fracture or dislocation was located,"As a result of the call, police were immediately dispatched to the bus terminal with witness officer (WO) #2 andWO#3 arriving first, andWO#1 and the subject officer (SO) arriving seconds later.WO#1,WO#3, andWO#2 were each armed with their service pistols, while theSOcarried a C-8 Carbine rifle;WO#1 andWO#3 also hadCEWs in their possession.  During the course of the interaction with police, both ofWO#1 andWO#3 discharged theirCEWs on one occasion each, and theSOdischarged his C-8 Carbine rifle three times.  Complainant #1 was shot once in his left flank, while Complainant #2 had a small fragment, from a bullet, strike his left shin.During the course of this investigation, six civilian and three police witnesses were interviewed, in addition to the two Complainants.  Fortunately, the fact are relatively easy to make out as the majority of interaction was recorded both by aCW, on his cell phone, and by theCCTVlocated in the bus terminal. The video footage, combined with the evidence of the witnesses, has allowed for an accurate and reliable summary of the incident to be formulated, which follows.  There is no dispute as to the facts.While the interview with Complainant #1 was very brief, he did tellSIUinvestigators that he had been in the bus terminal on the afternoon of April 1, 2018, that he had been armed with two knives, one in each hand, that the police officers had ordered him to drop the knives, which orders he ignored, following which he charged at the police officers and was first struck by aCEWand then shot in the left flank.  Complainant #1 indicated that his reasoning in charging at the officers with the knives was that he wanted to end his life.TheCCTVfootage confirms that Complainant #1 arrived at the bus terminal on the afternoon of April 1, 2018, and he is seen thereafter to be pacing inside the terminal with two knives, one in each hand.At approximately 6:10 p.m.,CW#2, a security officer working at the bus terminal, was in the security office viewing the security monitors, when he observed Complainant #1 holding a knife to his own neck and pacing up and down at the south end of the terminal building.CW#2 stated that he then stepped out of his office to investigate, and Complainant #1 made eye contact with him, while still holding the knife to his neck.CW#2 then re-entered his office and attempted to lock the door, butCW#2 charged at the door and began to kick it, whileCW#2, unable to get the door locked, braced the door and held it closed to prevent Complainant #1 from entering.CW#2 indicated that he feared for his life at that point.CW#2 then contacted Complainant #2, the security supervisor, by radio and advised him that he was calling 911.  Complainant #1 left the security office door and resumed his pacing in the terminal.Complainant #2, who had been upstairs in the terminal, then came down to the first floor where he too observed Complainant #1 and began to walk towards him; Complainant #2 observed Complainant #1 to have a knife in each hand.  When Complainant #1 spotted Complainant #2, he started to quickly move toward him, and Complainant #2, concerned for his safety, turned to enter the security office.  As he neared the security door,CW#2 reached out, grabbed Complainant #2, and pulled him into the office.  The two men then held the door to the office closed, while Complainant #1 attempted to force his way in.CW#2 then called 911.Moments later, two uniformedGSPSpolice officers,WO#2 andWO#3, arrived at the bus terminal, and Complainant #2 knocked on the exterior window to alert the officers of Complainant #1’s location inside the terminal.The first two officers’ arrival time was at 6:25 p.m.  When they first entered the terminal they observed Complainant #1, about 30 feet away at the south end of the terminal, pacing from side to side with two knives, one in each hand, with the blades pointing upward.  Both police officers yelled at Complainant #1 to, “Drop the knives!”  Complainant #1 was observed to look at the officers, but ignored the commands to drop the knives, instead taking a few steps towards the officers, who then moved back and away from Complainant #1.  The police officers then directed the other civilians in the area to vacate the building.WO#2 subsequently drew his service pistol and directedWO#3 to draw his conducted energy weapon (CEW), which he then did.WO#2 said that it was his hope that if Complainant #1 charged at them, and was struck with theCEW, that he would drop his weapons andWO#2 could go ‘hands on’ with him.At approximately 6:28 p.m.,WO#1 and theSOarrived at the terminal.  TheSOadvised the communications centre, via his radio, that he would be deploying his carbine assault rifle.  This is confirmed by the police transmission communications recording as a call originating from theSO, and received by the dispatcher at 6:27:52 p.m.TheSOthen ran toward the terminal, whileWO#1 followed on foot with his hand on his holstered service pistol; these officers entered the terminal through the west side doors.  TheSOthen took up a position at the west side wall;WO#1 moved to the left of theSO, at a distance of about five feet;WO#2 was to the left ofWO#1; and,WO#3 was to the left ofWO#2.  The four police officers stood the width of the corridor, with theSOstanding closest to the wall with the entrance foyer wall behind him.  The line of four police officers was approximately 30 feet from the location of Complainant #1, and they continued to yell at him to drop the knives.CW#3, a witness in the terminal at the time, estimated that the police officers commanded Complainant #1 to drop his weapons/knives some 15 to 20 times.This evidence is confirmed and recorded both on the cell phone video ofCW#3, as well as theCCTVfootage from the bus terminal.WO#1 drew hisCEW, which he pointed at Complainant #1’s centre mass, while theSOlevelled his carbine rifle at Complainant #1, andWO#2 had his side arm trained on Complainant #1 withWO#3 doing the same with hisCEW.WO#1 gave the shouted warning, “Taser, Taser!” in order to alert his colleagues that he intended to discharge hisCEW.Suddenly, Complainant #1 grunted, yelled, and charged at the line of police officers, with both arms up and the knife blades pointed towards the officers.  Each of the officers is observed on the videos as jumping backwards and away from Complainant #1, with the exception of theSO, who came up against the glass wall of the entrance foyer, which was directly behind him.WO#1 indicated that he discharged hisCEWwhen Complainant #1 was about 20 feet away, but when he saw that theCEWdischarge was ineffective, and Complainant #1 continued in his forward movement, he dropped hisCEWand reached for his service pistol.WO#3 advised that he discharged hisCEWwhen Complainant #1 was within 15 feet of the officers, but it too was ineffective and did not stop Complainant #1.BothWO#1 andWO#3 observed one or both of the probes from their respectiveCEWs make contact with Complainant #1’s chest and abdominal area, but it did not slow Complainant #1, as he continued to run at the officers.From the video, it appears that Complainant #1 was more focused on the three police officers who were backing away from him than he was on theSO, who was standing to his far left, backed into the corner between the exterior wall of the terminal and the glass enclosure of the foyer to the entrance doors.WO#2 sated that he backed up and pointed his firearm at the centre mass of Complainant #1, who was closing the distance between himself and the police officers very quickly;WO#2 had his finger on the trigger of his firearm ready to discharge.As Complainant #1 ran forward, toward the three retreating officers, he came to a position where he was parallel to theSO, and theSOturned toward him and discharged his rifle three times as Complainant #1 proceeded past him, striking Complainant #1 in the left flank.  Two of the three bullets were later found to have struck the security office, the corner of which was directly across from theSO, with one bullet fragment penetrating the wall and striking Complainant #2 in the left shin.WO#2 indicated that because he was squeezing the trigger of his firearm as Complainant #1 was nearing, he originally believed that it was he who had discharged his firearm when he heard the first gunshot, but when it was followed immediately by two more, he realized that it was theSOwho had fired on Complainant #1.When the bullet struck Complainant #1, he fell to the floor screaming, while the knives flew out of his hands and landed ahead of him, skidding across the floor.The police officers immediately moved in to handcuff and provide medical assistance to Complainant #1, while one of the officers shouted into his radio, “Shots fired!  Shots fired!”  When questioned byWO#1 as to his identity, Complainant #1 was heard to repeatedly mumble, “White power.”Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Further, pursuant to subsection 3:(3)  Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person … from death or grievous bodily harm.As such, in order for theSOto qualify for protection from prosecution under section 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.  Furthermore, pursuant to subsection 3, if death or grievous bodily harm is caused, it must further be established that the police officer did so believing on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in order to preserve himself or others under his protection from death or grievous bodily harm.Turning first to the lawfulness of Complainant #1’s apprehension, it is clear from both the 911 call and the direct observations of the four police officers present, as well as upon the evidence of the two Complainants and the six civilian witnesses, that Complainant #1 was in possession of weapons that were dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88 of theCriminal Code, and he was arrestable for that offence.  As such, the apprehension and arrest of Complainant #1 were legally justified in the circumstances.With respect to the other requirements pursuant to s.25(1) and (3), I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]The court describes the test required under s.25 in the following words:Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances. That is not the end of the matter. Section 25(3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force, i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily harm. The officer's belief must be objectively reasonable. This means that the use of force under s. 25(3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis (Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).The decision of Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice inChartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada above, sets out other relevant provisions of theCriminal Codeto be considered, as follows:27.

Zanibbi et al.).On the basis of the foregoing principles of law then, I must determine whether theSO:(1)	Subjectively, reasonably believed that he, or other persons under his protection, were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from Complainant #1 at the time that he discharged his firearm; and,(2)	Whether that belief was objectively reasonable, or, in other words, whether his actions would be considered reasonable by an objective bystander who had all of the information available to theSOat the time that he discharged his firearm.With respect to the first of these criteria, it is clear from the statement of the threeWOs (theSOhaving declined to provide a statement toSIUinvestigators, as is his legal right) that they believed that they were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm at the time that Complainant #1 charged at them with his two knives raised in the air and pointed in their direction, as a result of which theSOdischarged his firearm.The threeWOs appear to have based this belief on the information in their possession at the time, that being:That Complainant #1 was in possession of two large hunting style knives;That a 911 call had been received outlining this same information;That Complainant #1 was aware of the police presence but had refused to comply with repeated commands to drop his weapons;That the deployment of twoCEWs, which had made contact with Complainant #1, had been ineffective; and,That Complainant #1 was continuing to charge at the police officers with his weapons raised and was quickly closing the distance between them, putting them at extreme risk.As such, while theSOdid not provide a statement, there is ample evidence that the three witness officers reasonably believed that they were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from Complainant #1 at the time that theSOdischarged his firearm.  Since each of the four police officers present were in possession of the same information at that time, I find that the beliefs by the three witness officers that their lives were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm would have been shared by theSO.  As such, I believe that there is ample evidence to answer question 1 in the affirmative, that theSO, subjectively, had reasonable grounds to believe that he, or the other three police officers present, were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from Complainant #1 at the time that he discharged his firearm.Turning then to question 2, with respect to whether or not there were objectively reasonable grounds to believe that the lives of the police officers inside the terminal were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from Complainant #1, one need only refer to the objective bystanders who actually witnessed the actions of Complainant #1, as follows:A number of the witnesses, and Complainant #1 himself, confirmed that numerous demands had been made by the police officers for Complainant #1 to drop his weapons, all of which were ignored by Complainant #1;Complainant #2 andCW#2, who barricaded themselves inside the security office, both indicated that they feared for their safety from Complainant #1;CW#4, a Greater Sudbury Transit employee, indicated that Complainant #1 got very close to the three police officers with the knives poised and pointed in their direction, before theSOdischarged his rifle;CW#5 indicated that she believed that Complainant #1 was purposely attacking the police officers and was within eight feet of the officers when he was shot;CW#2 heard the police officers yell “Stop!” at Complainant #1 several times, as he ran toward them screaming, with the two knives raised on either side of his head;CW#1, an employee of the terminal, described Complainant #1 running toward the police officers with the knife, as if he was going to attack and kill the officers, and opined that theSOdid what he had to do in those circumstances; and,CW#3 described Complainant #1 as having two large knives which he described as “Hunting knives and take your life knives,” which he pointed out in front of him as he sprinted towards the officers in what he described as being in a  “Ready to die” fashion, while he quickly closed the gap between himself and the police officers.Additionally, the fact thatWO#1 dropped hisCEW, after the ineffective deployment, stepped back, and was reaching for his firearm, and thatWO#2 already had his firearm in hand and was squeezing the trigger, when theSOdischarged his rifle, appears to clearly substantiate that each of these two officers also felt that their lives were at risk from Complainant #1, and that they were each willing to resort to lethal force to protect themselves from death or grievous bodily harm.Furthermore, based on the statements of various witnesses, there is no dispute that the four police officers repeatedly tried to convince Complainant #1 to drop his weapons, that less lethal use of force options were resorted to prior to the gunshots being fired, and that all officers retreated from Complainant #1, and were continuing to do so, while Complainant #1 continued to advance on the officers with his weapons poised.  As such, it appears clear that police did not immediately resort to the use of lethal force, but attempted first to resolve the situation by other means.Finally, having viewed both theCCTVfootage, and the footage as captured byCW#3 with his cellphone, it is clear that this was a fast-moving and fluid situation, with Complainant #1 suddenly charging at the police officers with weapons raised, while the officers first resorted to the use of theCEWs, before then jumping back and retreating to save themselves.  On this evidence, I am unable to find that theSOhad any other viable option at that time to save the lives of his colleagues, other than the resort to lethal force.  I note, however, that as soon as Complainant #1 was hit and went to the floor, no further shots were fired.The law relating to the use of force intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm establishes that when one believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for one’s self-preservation from death or grievous bodily harm, or the preservation of others from death or bodily harm, then one is justified in using lethal force. Having extensively reviewed all of the evidence, I find in all the circumstances that theSOreasonably believed that the lives of the other three police officers were in immediate danger from Complainant #1, and that his decision to resort to a lethal use of force was therefore justified in this case.I find that it would have been foolish and reckless for theSOto risk the lives of these three police officers by waiting to see if Complainant #1 actually stabbed one of them, when that was clearly his intent as he charged at the officers.  I find that risk was not one thatSO#1 should have had to take, when faced with such a potential loss of life at the hands of Complainant #1.Finally, while this tragic incident is made even more so in that it involved a young man who was obviously in a state of crisis, even had police known that Complainant #1 may have suffered from some form of mental illness, when faced with the decision whether to shoot or risk a loss of human life, I am less than confident that this factor would necessarily have changed the decision of whether or not to resort to lethal force.In these circumstances, I will again refer to the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada as quoted above as being particularly apt in this particular factual scenario, in that “It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances.”I find, therefore, on this record, that the lethal force resorted to by theSO, which lead to the serious injury sustained by Complainant #1, and the less serious injury sustained by Complainant #2, was justified pursuant to s. 25(1) and (3) of theCriminal Code, and that theSO, in preserving the lives of his three colleagues, used no more force than was necessary to affect this lawful purpose.  As such, I lack the reasonable grounds to believe that the actions exercised by theSOfell outside the limits prescribed by the criminal law and instead find there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	February 22, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=251

,Windsor Police Service,Dufferin,Ontario,The cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds,"Approximately one minute and three seconds after the man was initially reported as having been located by the police, shortly after 8:12:14 a.m., a radio transmission was received from a police officer indicating, “Shots fired.  Shots Fired.  He wielded the knife and ran at officers,” followed shortly thereafter by a transmission fromSO#1 that, “I needEMS.  Step it up, please.  I’ve been stabbed in the hand.”At 9:29 a.m., the 33-year-old Complainant was pronounced dead at hospital.  A subsequent post-mortem examination revealed that the Complainant had sustained seven gunshot wounds as a result ofSO#1 andSO#2 discharging their firearms, and that the Complainant had died as a result of his injuries.An investigation was immediately launched bySIUinvestigators.  The objective of the investigation was to determine what happened in the intervening one minute and three seconds between the radio transmission confirming that the police had located the Complainant, and the broadcast that shots had been fired following an officer having been stabbed, and if the death of the Complainant was justified under the law, or if criminal charges were warranted against the police officers who caused that death.During the course of the investigation, 32 civilians came forward to offer evidence toSIUinvestigators, resulting in formal interviews being carried out with the 18 of those who had witnessed various segments of the interactions between the Complainant and the police officers; eight police witnesses were also interviewed.  The two subject officers,SO#1 andSO#2, both declined to be interviewed by theSIUand opted not to turn over their memorandum book notes of the incident to investigators, as is their legal right.The investigation was somewhat aided by the availability ofCCTVfootage, which intermittently recorded the series of events which unfolded from the time that the Complainant entered the area of the Starbucks store in the area of Ouellette Avenue and Wyandotte Street East, leading up to the shooting in the parking lot of the McDonald’s at Wyandotte and Goyeau Streets.  However, theCCTVfootage failed to record the critical seconds surrounding the shooting as well as the shooting itself, but the determinative evidence as to what occurred between the Complainant and the two subject police officers could be established as a result of the cooperation of the 11 independent civilian eyewitnesses to the event and the real time narration of events which were recorded on the police transmissions communication recordings as police officers called them in.  As a result of the breadth of that evidence, an accurate timeline of the unfolding events was extrapolated, a summary of which follows.TheCCTVfootage reveals the Complainant walking across the Shoppers Drug Mart parking lot with the butcher block of kitchen knives, asSO#1 arrives in hisSUVpolice vehicle, followed byWO#1 andSO#2, in their individual police cruisers.SO#1 is seen to exit his vehicle and walk toward the Complainant, asWO#1 pulls up to the immediate left of the Complainant.  The video captures the Complainant briefly turning and apparently looking atSO#1.Just prior toSO#2 stopping his cruiser,SO#1 can be seen to reach the east sidewalk, stop, and turn to his right.  At the same time, the Complainant can be seen to turn and start to run atSO#1, resulting inSO#1 backing away and then running west, away from the Complainant, as the Complainant gives chase; both men are seen in close proximity and they appear to swing their arms at each other.SO#1 is then seen to fall backwards at the west end of the street, whileSO#2 is simultaneously seen to exit his cruiser.  The video then revealsSO#1 and the Complainant moving out of camera view and behind a utility pole, whileSO#2 approaches them with his arms extended.CW#5, an Outreach Worker with the Windsor Essex Community Health Centre, was on a ride along withSO#2, in his police cruiser, and had a direct view of the entire interaction between the Complainant and the police officers.CW#5, in her statement toSIUinvestigators, described hearing the radio broadcast about a man with a block of knives walking on Ouellette Avenue, and then seeing the Complainant, who was known to her, walking in the area.CW#5 related thatSO#2 turned his police cruiser around and tried to engage the Complainant in conversation, following whichSO#2 stopped his cruiser and got out to speak with the Complainant, whileWO#1 also stopped his police cruiser behindSO#2’s vehicle.SO#2, according toCW#5, then approached the Complainant and asked where he was going, to which the Complainant gaveSO#2 ‘the finger’ and a wave gesture.WO#1 then lowered his window and told the Complainant that he needed to stop, but the Complainant continued walking toward the Shoppers Drug Mart parking lot.SO#2 then broadcast his location andCW#5 heardSO#1 respond that he was, “on it”.  AsSO#2 then drove into the Shoppers Drug Mart parking lot,CW#5 observed thatSO#1 was already there, with his cruiser blocking Dufferin Place.CW#5 then described the Complainant walking, in full stride, into the McDonald’s parking lot, where he stopped and turned to faceSO#1.CW#5 observed thatSO#1 had his hand on his conducted energy weapon (CEW) when the Complainant grabbed one knife out of the block, dropped the butcher block, and charged atSO#1;SO#1 had drawn hisCEWby that point.CW#5 describedSO#2 as parking his police cruiser while the Complainant was charging atSO#1, making crossing, slashing motions atSO#1’s neck with his knife, whileSO#1 backed away, across Dufferin Place, to a concrete wall near a utility pole, which then obstructedCW#5’s view.CW#5 observedSO#1 grab at the knife in the Complainant’s possession, with his right hand, in what she described as an effort to protect himself.CW#5 also indicated that she believed that, at that time, the Complainant had an “intent to kill.”CW#5 observedSO#1 kick and push at the Complainant, but she was unable to determine ifSO#1 was able to deploy hisCEW.  The Complainant then fell to the ground and dropped the knife, but was able to again retrieve the knife and get back to his feet.SO#2, who was standing on the roadway at that point, yelled, “Stop!” causing the Complainant to turn his attention to him, following which the Complainant ran atSO#2, at full sprint, with the knife in hand.CW#5 described the Complainant as running while bent over, like a linebacker, with his knees bent, and that he was arched forward with the knife raised in his hand.  When the Complainant had closed the gap between himself andSO#2 to roughly five to eight feet,SO#2 fired his weapon.  According toCW#5, it appeared to her that the initial shots had little effect, but the Complainant eventually fell to the ground; both police officers then told the Complainant to stay on the ground.CW#5 estimated that the entire incident spanned no more than about five seconds.CW#6, who was in the drive-thru lane at the McDonald’s, observedSO#1 to the right of her own motor vehicle walking backwards, while a male, the Complainant, walked towards the officer from a distance of about two to three feet, while making stabbing motions with a steak knife that he had in his hand.CW#6 describedSO#1 telling the Complainant to stop, following whichSO#1 fell onto his back and the Complainant continued to move toward the officer while trying to stab him, withSO#1 kicking at the Complainant, in order to protect himself.CW#6 described the Complainant then turning away fromSO#1 and focusing his attention to the north, from where she could hear some yelling.  The Complainant then took two or three steps away fromSO#1, at which pointCW#6 saw thatSO#2 was positioned to the north.  The Complainant then approachedSO#2, to within about seven feet, whenSO#2 deployed hisCEW, which appeared to have no effect as the Complainant continued to approach andSO#2 began to walk backwards.CW#6 then lost sight ofSO#2 and the Complainant, but observedSO#1 to get back to his feet;CW#6 then heard six gunshots.CW#6 estimated that from the time of the deployment of theCEWuntil the time of the gunshots, approximately 60 to 90 seconds had elapsed.CW#2, who was working at the drive-thru window at the McDonald’s, heard a loud “pop” and she looked over and saw The Complainant “raging” toward a police officer, while holding his right hand in a stabbing motion above his head. She observed the police officer to reverse across the road, but when The Complainant came within approximately five to seven feet of the officer, she heard two more “pops” in quick succession.  The Complainant then briefly continued toward the officer, before falling to the ground within about two to three feet of the officer.CW#9, who was in her motor vehicle driving on Wyandotte Street East, observed the Complainant carrying knives as he walked through the Shoppers Drug Mart parking lot and then entered the McDonald’s parking lot.  She then observed a police officer approach the Complainant, who dropped the knives, save for one, which he kept in his hand as he approached the police officer.CW#9 then heard the police officer repeatedly tell the man to drop the knife, but the man kept approaching the police officer, who backed away across Dufferin Place, until he backed up into a half-wall near the Shoppers Drug Mart parking lot, where the man attacked the police officer.CW#9 heard what she believed was aCEW, but saw no effect from the deployment, and heard commands for the man to drop the knife.CW#9 then heard a gunshot just as the Complainant turned to his right and began to look at a second police officer.WhileCW#9 professed a dislike of both the police and theSIU, she opined that in her view, the shooting of the Complainant was justified.CW#7, who was seated in a motor vehicle, saw the Complainant walking across the Shoppers Drug Mart parking lot, with a bearded police officer,SO#1, walking behind him and yelling at him; it appeared toCW#7 that the officer was trying to get the man to stop.CW#7 then observed the Complainant drop something from his hands, whereupon he saw that the man was armed with what appeared to him to be a large knife.  The man then turned and quickly walked toward the police officer, while waving the knife in a stabbing motion.  When the Complainant came to be within three feet of the police officer,CW#7 observed the officer back away, with his arm extended and almost touching the Complainant.CW#7’s view then became obstructed, following which he heard at least four gunshots in rapid succession, but could not see from where they had originated.CW#4, who was operating the motor vehicle in whichCW#7 was a passenger, heardCW#7 say, “Oh my God, he’s got a knife,” following which she saw a man with a large knife in his right hand making stabbing motions at a bearded police officer (SO#1).  She described the Complainant andSO#1 as being about 18 inches apart as they scuffled and the man tried to stab the police officer, while the officer tried to defend himself by grabbing at the man.CW#4 then heard four gunshots.CW#3, who was also working the McDonald’s drive-thru window, saw a uniformed police officer in foot pursuit of a man who was walking east through the Shoppers Drug Mart parking lot, before crossing Dufferin Place, and entering the McDonald’s lot.CW#3 then observed the two men stop on a grassy area near the parking lot exit;CW#3 observed thatSO#1 had aCEWin his hand and he appeared to be speaking to the Complainant, who then started to approach him with something in his hand.  When the Complainant charged atSO#1,SO#1 then deployed hisCEW, but it appeared to have no effect.SO#1 then fell backward at the curb, while protecting his face, as he fended off the Complainant’s attack.CW#3 described the attack onSO#1 as the Complainant making stabbing motions at the officer.CW#3 then described another police car arriving and a police officer,SO#2, jumping out of the cruiser and drawing his pistol and aiming it at the Complainant.  The Complainant then charged atSO#2, as the officer backed away while yelling at the Complainant.CW#3 observedSO#2 to discharge his firearm, while the Complainant continued to charge at him.CW#3 then described a pause, followed by the police officer firing another round, which then stopped the Complainant, who fell to the ground.CW#16 was driving his motor vehicle eastbound on Wyandotte Street East when he heard a gunshot, and then saw a man engaging with police officers.CW#16 described the man, the Complainant, as yelling at a police officer and appearing, “out of control”, as the police officers yelled back at him.  When the man then charged at one of the police officers,CW#16 heard three or four gunshots following which the Complainant fell to the ground.CW#16 estimated that there was a gap of some seven to eight seconds between the first gunshot and the volley that followed later.CW#16 also described the Complainant as being out of control and indicated that he was of the belief that the police officers had no other choice than to use lethal force against the Complainant.CW#11, who walked out onto Dufferin Place when he heard yelling, observedSO#1 being rushed by a man and the two men then struggling, while the officer tried to push the Complainant away.CW#11’s view became obstructed when the two men reached the half-wall, but he observed a second police officer,SO#2, exit his cruiser and approach, while trying to get the Complainant’s attention.CW#11 then observed thatSO#2 discharged his firearm two or three times.CW#11 estimated that the entire interaction lasted some 15 to 20 seconds.CW#19 was leaving the McDonald’s parking lot on foot, when she observed a man cradling a block of knives under his left arm.CW#19 then sawSO#1, as he approached the man and told him to stop, following which the man turned to face the officer, grabbed a steak knife, dropped the block of knives, and then attacked the police officer with the knife.  She described the Complainant’s actions as, “going wild and attacking the police officer,” and slashing at him, while the officer,SO#1, backed away and his right palm was slashed by the knife.CW#19 describedSO#1 as continuing to back away, across Dufferin Place, where he withdrew hisCEWand deployed it against the Complainant, with no apparent effect.CW#19 then observed a second police officer,SO#2, yell at the Complainant to stop and he too deployed hisCEWwith no apparent effect.CW#19 then observedSO#2 to draw his firearm and shoot the man three or four times.CW#19 opined that the police officers, “did awesome considering what happened,” and she was of the view that they did not do “anything wrong.”CW#14, who was operating a bus on Wyandotte Street East at the time, observedSO#1 following the Complainant on foot, before the Complainant stopped, turned, and went after the police officer while swinging his fists at the officer.CW#14 observedSO#1 back away, across Dufferin Street, and stop near a utility pole on the west side.CW#14 then saw a second police officer,SO#2, get the Complainant’s attention, and the Complainant turned and approachedSO#2, coming within about six to seven feet ofSO#2, whenCW#14 heard three “pop” sounds.CW#14 later observed a knife on the ground beside the Complainant, while the police officers were attempting life-saving measures.While I have not detailed the evidence of all of the witnesses here, I note that the evidence of these witnesses is consistent with the evidence of all of the other witnesses, as well as theCCTVfootage, the only discrepancy being in the evidence ofCW#6 andCW#19, who were both of the view thatSO#2 had discharged hisCEWat the Complainant.  This evidence, however, is contradicted by the download data for theCEWs in the possession ofSO#1 andSO#2, which confirmed that onlySO#1 discharged hisCEWand he only did so on one occasion, for a single five second deployment, whileSO#2 at no time had hisCEWarmed, nor did he ever discharge it. This evidence is further confirmed by the fact that aCEWwith wires extended to probes in the Complainant’s jacket was found on the ground next toSO#1.I find that the physical evidence of the location of a brown handled steak knife on the ground beside the Complainant, as well as the cut toSO#1’s hand, further supports the eyewitness evidence supplied by the independent witnesses.Examination of the firearms, in the possession ofSO#1 andSO#2, revealed thatSO#1 had discharged his firearm on two occasions, whileSO#2 discharged his firearm five times.  The post-mortem examination of the Complainant’s body, while revealing seven injuries related to his being struck by gunfire, could only determine that five were possibly separate injuries, with one bullet possibly being responsible for three of the different injuries sustained.  Furthermore, one of the gunshot wounds was considered fatal (wound listed as #4 in the post-mortem report), while two were considered potentially life-threatening (wounds 5 and 6).On the basis of this very compelling evidence, then, I find thatSO#1 initially pursued the Complainant on foot, in order to speak with him, following which the Complainant turned, dropped the knife block, and then charged atSO#1 with a knife in hand.  As a result,SO#1 attempted to back away from the Complainant, and he withdrew, and at some point discharged, hisCEW, without any apparent effect on the Complainant.SO#1 backed up and tried to increase the distance between himself and the Complainant, crossing Dufferin Place, closely followed by the Complainant, who continued to swing his knife atSO#1.  When the two men reached the half-wall described by witnesses as being in the Shoppers Drug Mart parking lot,SO#1 then fell against the curb, and the Complainant continued to slash at him with the knife, at some point either slashingSO#1, or causingSO#1’s hand to be cut when he tried to disarm the Complainant.I further find that uponSO#2 exiting his cruiser, he observed the attack onSO#1 and he tried to distract the Complainant away fromSO#1, in order, presumably, to saveSO#1’s life.  When the Complainant then closed the gap between himself andSO#2, to within seven or eight feet, despiteSO#2 trying to back away and increase the distance between them,SO#2 discharged his firearm.On the basis that a single gunshot was initially heard, followed thereafter, several seconds later, by a volley of shots, I find that it is likely thatSO#1 initially discharged his firearm while the Complainant was attacking him with the knife, and that, once the Complainant advanced onSO#2 and began to close the gap between himself andSO#2,SO#2 discharged a volley of shots and, in all likelihood,SO#1 then also again discharged his firearm.  While it is impossible to determine with certainty the order of the gunshots in the absence of any evidence fromSO#1 andSO#2, in this case it is not necessary to do so, as I find that this is a reasonable scenario based on the evidence of the 11 independent civilian witnesses, which is further consistent with the examination of the firearms ofSO#1 andSO#2.The Law and AnalysisThe question that remains to be answered, then, on the facts as I have found them, is whether or notSO#1 andSO#2 were justified in using lethal force against the Complainant, or whether the discharging of their respective firearms at the Complainant was an excessive use of force in these circumstances and provides reasonable grounds for the laying of criminal charges againstSO#1 and/orSO#2 for causing the death of the Complainant.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Codeof Canada, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Further, pursuant to subsection 3:(3)  … a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.As such, in order forSO#1 andSO#2 to qualify for protection from prosecution under section 25, it must be established that they were in the execution of a lawful duty, that they were acting on reasonable grounds, and that they used no more force than was necessary.  Furthermore, pursuant to subsection 3, since death was caused, it must also be established thatSO#1 andSO#2 discharged their firearms believing on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in order to preserve themselves, or each other, from death or grievous bodily harm.Turning first to the lawfulness of the attempted apprehension of the Complainant, it is clear from the call to theWPSthat there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was behaving oddly and was possibly in possession of one or more weapons (the eight knives in the knife block) dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88 of theCriminal Code.  As such, I am satisfied that the police officers who were dispatched, in response to the call from the Starbucks employee, were acting lawfully when they responded to a complaint by concerned citizens and attempted to engage with, and investigate, the Complainant; as such, their actions leading up their first contact with the Complainant were legally justified in the circumstances.  Thereafter, when the Complainant then extracted one knife from the block and began to use it as a weapon, there were more than ample grounds for police to arrest the Complainant pursuant to s. 88 of theCriminal Code.With respect to the other requirements pursuant to s.25(1) and (3), I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]The court describes the test required under s.25 as follows:Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances. That is not the end of the matter. Section 25(3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force, i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily harm. The officer's belief must be objectively reasonable. This means that the use of force under s. 25(3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis (Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).The decision of Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada above, sets out other relevant provisions of theCriminal Codeto be considered, as follows:27. 	Use of force to prevent commission of offence - Everyone is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary(a)	to prevent the commission of an offence(i) for which, if it were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and(ii) that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone, or(b)	to prevent anything being done that, on reasonable grounds, he believes would, if it were done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).This Section, therefore, authorizes the use of force to prevent the commission of certain offenses. Everyone would include a police officer. The force must not be more than that which is reasonably necessary. Therefore, an objective test is called for. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Scopelliti (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 held that the use of deadly force can be justified only in either cases of self-defence or in preventing the commission of a crime likely to cause immediate and serious injury.34(1) 	Self-defence against unprovoked assault - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him to defend himself.(2)	Extent of justification - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified if(a)	he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and(b)	he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.In order to rely on the defence under subsection (2) of Section 34, a police officer would have to demonstrate that he/she was unlawfully assaulted and caused death or grievous bodily harm to the assaulter in repelling the assault. The police officer must demonstrate that he or she reasonably apprehended that death or grievous bodily harm would result to him or her and that he or she, again on reasonable grounds, believed that he/she could not otherwise preserve himself/herself from death or grievous bodily harm. Again, the use of the term reasonable requires the application of an objective test.The court also sets out a number of other legal principles gleaned from the legal precedents cited, including the following:(h) 	Whichever section of theCriminal Codeis used to assess the actions of the police, the Court must consider the level of force that was necessary in light of the circumstances surrounding the event.(i) 	""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". The same applies to the use of force in making an arrest or preventing an escape. Like the driver of a vehicle facing a sudden emergency, the policeman ""cannot be held to a standard of conduct which one sitting in the calmness of a court room later might determine was the best course."" (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).(j) 	Police officers perform an essential function in sometimes difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. The police must not be unduly hampered in the performance of that duty. They must frequently act hurriedly and react to sudden emergencies. Their actions must therefore be considered in the light of the circumstances.(k) 	""It is both unreasonable and unrealistic to impose an obligation on the police to employ only the least amount of force which might successfully achieve their objective. To do so would result in unnecessary danger to themselves and others. They are justified and exempt from liability in these situations if they use no more force than is necessary, having regard to their reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers in which they find themselves"" (Levesque v. Zanibbi et al.).On the basis of the foregoing principles of law then, I must determine:(1)	WhetherSO#1 andSO#2 subjectively believed that they, or others,  were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant at the time that they discharged their firearms; and,(2)	Whether that belief was objectively reasonable, or, in other words, whether their actions would be considered reasonable by an objective bystander who had all of the information available to him, thatSO#1 andSO#2 had at the time that they discharged their firearms.With respect to the first of these criteria, it is clear from the statement of the many civilian witnesses, thatSO#1 andSO#2 would have subjectively believed that they, and/or each other, were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm at the time that they discharged their firearms.  That subjective belief can be inferred from the observations of the witnesses (who were directly observing the incident) which confirmed that as the incident unfolded, the Complainant was armed with a knife, that he was quickly advancing initially onSO#1, with knife in hand, and later onSO#2, thatSO#1 had fallen and was at risk of being seriously injured, if not killed, by the Complainant, thatSO#1 had already been injured by the Complainant with the knife in his possession, that the Complainant was swinging the knife in such a way as to indicate that it was his intent to stab both of these police officers, while quickly advancing upon them, with knife in hand, and that the Complainant refused either to stop or to drop his weapon.  Given that the previous deployment of theCEWhad been ineffective, it left the subject officers only one option by which to effectively stop the Complainant from causing them serious injury or death, that being resort to a firearm.On all of the information thatSO#1 andSO#2 had in their possession at the time that they shot and killed the Complainant, I find that they, subjectively, had reasonable grounds to believe that their own lives, and the lives of each other, were at risk from the Complainant, and that their observations of the Complainant’s actions would have reasonably causedSO#1 andSO#2 to believe that they, or each other, were at imminent risk of being seriously injured, if not killed, by the Complainant.In considering the reasonableness ofSO#1 andSO#2’s actions and whether or not they considered less lethal use of force options before resorting to their firearms, I note that the witnesses indicated that the officers had repeatedly instructed the Complainant to drop his weapons, which appeared to have fallen on deaf ears.  Additionally, as confirmed by several of the independent civilian witnesses, the evidence located at the scene, and theCEWdownload data,SO#1 had already resorted to the only other less lethal use of force option available to stop the Complainant, which, for whatever reason, had proven ineffective, thereby leaving only lethal use of force as a viable alternative.  On that basis, it is clear thatSO#1 andSO#2, in the few short seconds available to them after the deployment of theCEWbySO#1, and while the Complainant was quickly advancing upon firstSO#1, and thenSO#2, with a deadly weapon, appeared to have considered all of their options before they each respectively discharged their firearms.With respect to whether or not there were objectively reasonable grounds to believe that the lives ofSO#1 andSO#2 were at risk, one need only refer to the evidence of the independent witnesses, which described the Complainant as advancing on the two police officers and swinging and slashing a knife in their direction, while both officers attempted to retreat and increase the distance between themselves and the Complainant.  I have made further note of the comments ofCW#5, who described the Complainant as charging first atSO#1, with an, “intent to kill,” whileSO#1 tried to fight him off, and later atSO#2, with “full intent”; ofCW#6 who described the Complainant as trying to stabSO#1 as he lay on the ground on his back trying to protect himself against the Complainant; ofCW#2, who described the Complainant as “raging” towardSO#2 with a knife in his right hand, which he moved in a stabbing motion above his head; ofCW#9, who, despite her dislike of police, opined that the shooting of the Complainant by police was justified, as the officers were being “attacked” by the Complainant; ofCW#19, who opined that the officers did nothing wrong; ofCW#4 andCW#3, who described the Complainant with a large knife in his hand trying to stabSO#1, asSO#1 tried to defend himself; ofCW#3 who also described the Complainant as then charging atSO#2; and ofCW#16, who opined that the Complainant was out of control and that the police officers had no other choice, than to use lethal force against him.Additionally, one has to consider the evidence ofCW#14, who observed the knife beside the Complainant after he had been shot, confirming that when the independent witnesses saw the Complainant advancing onSO#1 andSO#2, he was indeed armed with a knife, as well as the evidence of theCEWwith the two probes still lodged in the Complainant’s jacket, which confirmed that theCEWhad indeed been discharged at the Complainant but had failed to stop his attack on the police officers.A review of the law relating to the justification in using force intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm establishes that when one believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for one’s self-preservation from death or grievous bodily harm, or the preservation of others, then the use of lethal force is justifiable.  Having extensively reviewed all of the evidence I find in all the circumstances of this case thatSO#1 andSO#2 reasonably believed that their lives, and the lives of each other, were in danger from the Complainant and thus their actions in firing upon the Complainant were justified.  I find that it would have been foolish and reckless forSO#1 andSO#2 to risk their lives by waiting for the Complainant, with knife in hand, to further close the gap between himself and the officers thereby putting their own lives, and the lives of each other, at immediate risk of serious injury or death.  I further find that risk was not one thatSO#1 andSO#2 ought to have had to take when faced with a knife yielding man who had shown he was not reluctant to use it and who was quickly advancing and slashing a dangerous weapon against the two officers.I find, therefore, on this record, that the shots that were fired bySO#1 andSO#2, which struck and killed the Complainant, were justified pursuant to ss.25 (1) and (3) of theCriminal Codeand thatSO#1 andSO#2, in preserving themselves and each other from death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant, used no more force than was necessary to affect that lawful purpose.  As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised bySO#1 andSO#2, despite the tragic loss of life, fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	January 31, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=223

,,Durham,Ontario,When seen at hospital it was determined that he had sustained dog bites to his left forearm left thigh and scrotum there were no fractures or vascular damage associated with the bites to the arm and no injury to the testicle or neurovascular compromise as a result of the bite to the groin,"In the Complainant’s statement toSIUinvestigators, he described having been asleep in the GMC Envoy, and being unaware of any police pursuit, until the vehicle in which he was riding crashed at the side of the 401 and he exited the vehicle and began to walk away.  According to the Complainant, he was walking away from the vehicle in order to call his mother to pick him up and take him home.The Complainant claimed that he did not hear any commands nor did he see any police officers chasing him, and that he was unaware of why the police might be chasing him, but he felt a police dog bite his left arm, following which he fell onto his right side and held his left arm up, and then he rolled onto his back.  The dog, the Complainant alleges, then bit his left forearm four to five times, before it bit his testicle.  A police officer,SO#2, the K-9 handler, then arrived immediately thereafter and commanded the dog to release, which the dog then did.The Complainant indicated that he tried to push the dog off of himself, whenSO#1 arrived and stepped on the Complainant’s right hand, which was positioned sideways, causing the bone fracture in his hand.  He alleged thatSO#1 then stated, “If you hit the dog, it’s like assaulting a police officer.”  The Complainant then remained on the ground, until an ambulance arrived and he was taken to hospital.During the course of this investigation, in addition to the Complainant, one civilian witness from the fleeing GMC Envoy was interviewed, while the second occupant of the GMC Envoy declined to provide a statement.  The doctor who assessed and treated the Complainant was also interviewed with respect to the Complainant’s injuries and his medical opinion as to the possible mechanism of the broken bone in the Complainant’s hand.  In addition to the civilian witnesses, six police witnesses provided statements toSIUinvestigators and turned over their memo book notes to be reviewed.  Of the two subject officers, the K-9 officer,SO#2, declined to be interviewed, but provided a prepared written statement, whileSO#1 consented to an interview; neither officer provided their memorandum book notes to theSIU, which is their legal right.The only two civilians, other than the Complainant, who were present when the GMC crashed and the occupants fled, were the other two occupants,CW#1 andCW#2; whileCW#2 declined to be interviewed,CW#1 provided a statement toSIUinvestigators in which he indicated that he too was an occupant, but not the driver, of the stolen motor vehicle.  Unlike the Complainant, however,CW#1 described the Complainant not as walking away from the vehicle in order to call his mother, but fleeing from the scene on foot in an attempt to evade the police officers.CW#1 indicated in his statement that he saw the Complainant flee, but was unsure in which direction he ran, and that he observedSO#2 pursue the Complainant on foot, with his police service dog initially on leash, but released bySO#2 after they ran approximately five metres.CW#1 described the dog as then biting the Complainant, causing him to fall to the ground;CW#1 did not see anything more of the interaction between police, the dog, and the ComplainantIn coming to my decision with respect to whether the evidence provides me with reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer involved in the pursuit, apprehension, or subsequent arrest of the Complainant committed a criminal offence, I will divide the interaction into three distinct areas:   the vehicular pursuit; the apprehension of the Complainant by the police service dog leading to the Complainant being bitten on the left forearm, left thigh, and scrotum; and, the allegation by the Complainant thatSO#1 caused the fracture in his hand whenSO#1 stepped on his right hand, as he lay on the ground.With respect to the first of these two areas, I note that there is no dispute as to the evidence, in that, with respect to the vehicular pursuit, the Complainant indicated in his statement to theSIUthat he was asleep in the GMC and had no knowledge or awareness of any police pursuit or efforts by the police to stop the vehicle, and therefore was unable to assistSIUinvestigators with respect to the details of the pursuit, and with respect to the dog biting him; the evidence of the Complainant is consistent with that of the police officers present.  With respect to the third arm of my analysis, that being the alleged actions ofSO#1 leading to the fracture of the Complainant’s right hand, that allegation is firmly denied bySO#1 and requires me to assess the reliability of the evidence in order to come to my conclusion.While there is no dispute as to the facts of the first two of the three interactions with police, I must still analyze all three of the interactions with a view to determining whether the actions of police were justified in the circumstances, or if they contravened theCriminal Code, thereby providing me with reasonable grounds to lay criminal charges.The Vehicular PursuitWhile the initial portion of the interaction between the Complainant and theDRPSinvolved a police pursuit, since there is no allegation that any injury was sustained during the pursuit, it does not technically invoke the mandate of theSIU.  As indicated earlier, however, as an investigation was launched, it is my intention to assess the actions of police in all three areas.  The following facts, which are not disputed, have been gleaned from a review of all of the reliable evidence:At approximately 11:52:30 p.m., on March 6, 2018,WO#3, of theDRPS, observed a motor vehicle, a GMC Envoy, which came to his attention because it was driving excessively slowly within the City of Oshawa.WO#3 followed the vehicle, and subsequently noted that a tail light was out.  He then queried the licence plate of the vehicle on his computer, and discovered that the vehicle had been reported stolen.WO#3 then requested the assistance of other units, prior to initiating a vehicle stop.WO#3 followed the GMC onto a dead end street and activated his emergency lights, as he anticipated that the occupants of the vehicle would try to flee.WO#3 then angled his car across the roadway in order to block the potential exit of the GMC; in response, the GMC made a three-point turn and accelerated towardWO#3’s police vehicle, ramming the rear quarter panel of the cruiser, causing significant damage, before the GMC then sped away on Bloor Street.This evidence is confirmed by the police radio transmissions, whereinWO#3 is heard, at 11:52:30 p.m., to request a ‘rolling check’ on a licence plate number in the area of Simcoe and Bloor Streets, and he received a response at 11:53:14 indicating that the vehicle was reported as having been stolen.  The vehicle was described as a GMC Envoy, black in colour.At 11:53:29 p.m.,WO#3 can be heard to acknowledge this information and he updates his location as being westbound on Bloor Street, approaching Park Road.  Shortly thereafter, he requested other units in the area to assist him, and he received a response from an unidentified officer that he will be ‘right there’.At 11:53:55 p.m.,WO#3 transmits that he is travelling westbound and then, at 11:53:59 p.m., he reports his location as Park Road South and Bloor.At 11:54:25 p.m.,WO#3 reports that, “He’s going to try and go around me here,” followed seven seconds later by, “He rammed me, Control!  He’s going to be eastbound Bloor … Eastbound Bloor!” and, at 11:54:41 p.m., he is heard to report, “He rammed at the rear end … about Park and Bloor.”WO#3 then pursued the GMC while constantly updating his location, as follows:At 11:55:06 p.m., the dispatcher enquired, “Are you in pursuit?” and at 11:55:06 p.m.,WO#3 responded, “I’m trying to catch up to him.  He’s going to be northbound Simcoe from Bloor.”At 11:55:18,WO#3 requested, “Can you notifyOPP?  He’s likely gonna hit the highway.  It’s a stolen vehicle from Scarborough, I believe.”Thereafter, numerous unidentified officers are heard to update their locations and to indicate that traffic was light; they also transmitted the speeds of their respective vehicles as they continued on the 401 heading westbound.At 11:56:22 p.m.,WO#3 transmitted that, “His vehicle is losing debris here.  I think he’s blown a tire … yeah, I think he’s blown a tire.  I’m going to get ready … (transmission is poor here, and words are unclear, but may possibly be) they’re going to bail here.”At 11:57:11p.m., and thereafter, there was discussion about setting up a rolling block and that there was no traffic in the area.  A sergeant is heard on the radio requesting the reason for the pursuit and providing direction to the responding officers.At 11:59:15 p.m.,WO#3 again updated the dispatcher indicating that the suspect vehicle was not driving erratically and was maintaining its lane.  There is then further discussion about the positioning of police vehicles to perform a rolling block.At 12:00:10 a.m.,WO#3 broadcast, “He’s going to crash here!”And at 12:00:31 a.m., an officer is heard to yell, “Get on the ground!”At 12:00:39 a.m., an officer reported that he was in foot pursuit and at 12:00:04 a.m., it was reported that one party was under arrest and the officer is ‘10-4’ (all in order).At 12:01:19 a.m., an officer reported, “We got one that’s running southbound ... or northbound through the fields.  K-9 is on him.”WO#3 then remained with the GMC, while other officers took up the foot pursuit.I accept this sequence of events as accurate not only because it is not disputed by any of the three occupants of the GMC Envoy, but because it is fully consistent with the communications recording, which provides a real time narration of events which were recorded by the communications centre as police officers called them in, without the opportunity for memories to fade, or be influenced by others.From this evidence, it is clear thatWO#3 was acting within his lawful duties both when he initially attempted to stop and investigate the GMC under s. 216 of theHighway Traffic Act(HTA) because it was driving excessively slowly and it had one burnt out tail light, but even more so after his police vehicle was intentionally rammed by the driver of the GMC, when he clearly had more than sufficient grounds to pursue the GMC, not only for the criminal offences of dangerous driving and assault with a weapon, but also based on the information received by him that the motor vehicle was stolen.Furthermore, I note thatWO#3, along with all of the police officers engaged in the vehicular pursuit, did so in compliance with Ontario Regulation 266/10 of the OntarioPolice Services ActentitledSuspect Apprehension Pursuits, in that they notified and were in constant contact with the communications centre, they constantly updated the dispatcher as to the location and speed of the GMC and their own police vehicles, they resorted to alternative measures in that they attempted to box in the motor vehicle to try and stop it, and a sergeant,WO#4, was monitoring and assessing the pursuit in order to determine whether or not to discontinue the pursuit and if the risk to public safety that may result from the pursuit outweighed the risk to public safety that may result if an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle was not immediately apprehended.  Ultimately, however, the driver lost control and the vehicle left the roadway and crashed into the ditch before either any alternative measures could be put into place, or a determination to possibly discontinue the pursuit could be made.In addition to complying with theSuspect Apprehension Pursuit Policy, and based on the undisputed evidence that: the weather was good, the roads were dry, the area of the pursuit was well lit by artificial lighting, and that traffic was extremely light, and finding no evidence that any of the officers involved in the pursuit posed a danger to other drivers nor did they interfere with other traffic, it is further clear that I lack any reasonable grounds to believe that any of the officers involved in the pursuit of the GMC Envoy committed a criminal offence, in that their driving did not rise to the level of being dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249 (1) of theCriminal Code, nor did it amount to criminal negligence contrary to s.219 of theCriminal Code, as defined by the Supreme Court of Canada[1]and by our Court of Appeal,[2]respectively.As such, based on the undisputed evidence, I find that the vehicular pursuit of the GMC Envoy does not provide me with reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer involved in the pursuit ran afoul of the aforementioned provisions of theCriminal Code.Deployment of the Police Service Dog (PSD)According toSO#2, in his written statement, he is an experienced canine handler and his dog is trained to chase down and apprehend fleeing suspects; the definition of apprehend, as it applies toPSDs in general, andSO#2’s dog in particular, is that the dog will grip and compress his mouth on (or bite) any available part of the suspect person’s body to prevent escape, stop violence toward police, and to gain control and compliance in order to allow police to effect a safe arrest.  Furthermore,SO#2’s dog was trained to maintain his hold on a suspect (or not to release him from his bite) until he was commanded to do so by his handler,SO#2.On March 6, 2018, after the GMC Envoy had left the roadway and crashed into the ditch,SO#2 observed the Complainant exit the driver’s door of the Envoy, which causedSO#2 to believe that the Complainant was the driver of the motor vehicle and therefore, of necessity, the party who was responsible both for the ramming ofWO#3’s police vehicle, as well as the operation of a speeding stolen motor vehicle which had fled from police at great speeds on both city roads and the 401 highway.WhenSO#2 observed the Complainant run from the stolen vehicle into a darkened field and away from the police,SO#2 and his dog gave chase on foot, withSO#2 yelling several times for the Complainant to stop, but the Complainant continued running.  I accept this evidence over that of the Complainant’s version that he simply walked away from the car and neither heard any police commands, nor was he aware that police were chasing him until he was bitten by the dog, based on the evidence ofCW#1 that the Complainant was running from police in an effort to escape, and on the communications recording, which confirms the evidence ofSO#2 in that a police officer is heard to yell very loudly, at 12:00:31 a.m., to, “Get on the ground!” following which an officer is heard to report that they were now in a foot pursuit.  Based on the evidence ofSO#2, I accept that he was the officer making these radio transmissions.According toSO#2, the Complainant was some 80 to 100 metres ahead of him,SO#2 was unable to gain any ground on the Complainant and, despiteSO#2 giving the Complainant numerous opportunities to stop and give himself up, the Complainant refused to stop, whichSO#2 interpreted as a clear desire to escape at any cost.SO#2 indicated, in his written statement, that he gave the Complainant several warnings that he should either stop or the dog would be released, without any apparent effect on the Complainant, who continued to run.SO#2 advised that at that point he felt he had no choice but to deploy his dog, as a last resort, to safely arrest the Complainant, at which point he released the dog, who then immediately ran after the Complainant; this evidence is entirely consistent with that of both the Complainant andCW#1SO#2 observed his dog then closing the gap on the Complainant, who then turned onto a pathway and disappeared fromSO#2’s view, around a dirt berm.  WhenSO#2 also made his way around the berm, he saw the Complainant on the ground fighting with thePSDand trying to get the dog off of him.SO#2 described seeing the Complainant’s arms going toward the dog’s head several times, while thePSDhad the Complainant grounded and was holding him untilSO#2’s arrival, as he had been trained to do.  I find this evidence also to be fully consistent with the account of the Complainant as to what occurred whenSO#2’s dog caught up to him and bit him.AsSO#2 approached the Complainant, he yelled at the Complainant to stop fighting and he would get the dog off of him, at which point the Complainant showed one of his arms, but not the other, which was still out of the sight ofSO#2 and therefore still capable of wielding a weapon, should he have one.SO#2 then observed that his dog had a hold of the Complainant by the crotch area, and he again told the Complainant to show both of his hands; once the Complainant complied,SO#2 then took control of thePSDand removed the dog from the Complainant  Again, I accept this evidence as being confirmed both by the Complainant himself, and by the communications recording, wherein an officer is first heard to report, at 12:01:19 a.m., that, “We got one that’s running southbound … or northbound through the fields.  Canine’s on him,” and later, at 12:01:29, when yelling is heard in the background and a voice is heard to yell, “Stop!”, and finally, whenSO#2 is heard to advise that he had one male in custody and he requested an ambulance, later advising that he needed the ambulance for a, “dog bite.  I think it’s to the penis.”While clearlySO#2’s dog was an extension of the police, and was in effect a use of force option, on the basis of this evidence, which appears not to be in dispute, I find that it would have been unsafe[3]forSO#2 to run blindly into the dark fields to search for a possibly armed and dangerous party and that it was far more prudent to send the dog ahead, after first giving the Complainant ample warnings and opportunities to surrender.While it is clear on all of the evidence that the police service dog bit the Complainant and caused his injuries, it is equally clear that had the Complainant not taken active steps to run from police, he would not have been bitten.  ThePSDwas behaving exactly as he was trained to do, in that, upon locating the Complainant, he gripped and compressed his mouth on (or bit) any available part of the Complainants body to prevent his escape. I further accept that the Complainant tried to fight off the dog, causing him to be bitten on more than one occasion, both on the arm, and later in the groin area.  I also find that whileSO#2, in the darkness and running through the fields, was unable to gain any ground on the Complainant, who was apparently continuing his efforts to escape, that the only option other than to allow the Complainant to run off, was to send in the dog to apprehend him, and that it would have been unwise forSO#2, even had he been able to catch up to the Complainant, to apprehend the Complainant in the darkness, while not knowing exactly what he might be facing, and with the knowledge that this party may have already been responsible for ramming a police vehicle, which clearly indicated a desire on his part to escape at any cost, including the cost of police lives or safety.SO#2’s dog apprehended the Complainant as he was both trained and directed to do, and held onto him until he was told to disengage by his handler.  It may well be that the time it took forSO#2 to come around the dirt berm, to catch up to thePSDand the Complainant, to convince the Complainant to show both of his hands, and then to approach and apprehend the Complainant, when it was safe to do so, delayed his ability to disengage the dog, and may therefore have caused thePSDto remain latched onto the Complainant longer than would be the case in other circumstances, I cannot help but conclude that this situation was one of the Complainant’s own making and could have been easily avoided had he simply come out and given himself up to police, rather than running and then fighting the dog when thePSDlocated him.In finding that this did not amount to an excessive use of force, I am mindful of the state of the law that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.) nor should they be judged to a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206. In the final analysis, I am of the opinion that it was the actions of the Complainant that caused the police to have to resort to the use of thePSDboth to catch up to, and to apprehend, the Complainant, and it was the further actions of the Complainant, in first fighting the dog and then refusing to show his hands, which caused thePSDto repeatedly have to bite the Complainant in order to maintain his hold on him until his handler arrived and told him to release.  Furthermore, it appears that it was the direct reaction of the dog to being fought and pushed by the Complainant that then caused him to bite him on more than one occasion, and on more than one area of his body, thereby causing the injuries to the Complainant. I also accept on the evidence of the Complainant himself, that at no time didSO#2 direct the dog to bite the Complainant and, as soon asSO#2 arrived at the Complainant’s location and the Complainant complied with the officer’s demands to show his hands,SO#2 immediately released the dog and took him under his control and away from the ComplainantOn all of the evidence, I find that the Complainant, of his own volition, decided to ignore the numerous commands bySO#2 to stop and get down on the ground and instead chose to run into the dark fields in his further bid to escape from the police.  I also accept on the Complainant’s own evidence that he chose to try to push the dog off, rather than submitting; he clearly made the wrong choice.  It was incumbent upon police to apprehend and arrest those responsible for rammingWO#3’s police vehicle, an action which clearly showed that the occupants of the GMC were both capable of violence and were intent on fleeing from police, and to arrest them.Had the Complainant simply come forward and given himself up, there would have been no need to deploy thePSD.  I do not accept the Complainant’s claims that he simply exited the GMC, without any knowledge of the presence of police. His account is contradicted not only by the radio communications recording and the police officers present, but byCW#1, the apparent accomplice of the Complainant, who clearly indicated that the Complainant exited the car and ran from police in a bid to escape.  The Complainant rolled the dice and lost.  These were decisions made by him and him alone, with the full knowledge and numerous warnings that the dog would be dispatched if the Complainant did not comply.  On the evidence before me, I find that I do not have reasonable grounds to believe thatSO#2 resorted to an excessive use of force in deploying hisPSDand therefore do not have reasonable grounds to believe that he committed any criminal offence and no charges will issue in this regard.SO #1 and the Fracture of The Complainant’s HandAs alluded to above, I find that I am unable to accept the evidence of the Complainant as being credible and reliable, for a number of reasons, a sampling of which follows:The Complainant’s assertion that he was asleep in the GMC both during the ramming ofWO#3’s police vehicle, which, judging from the damage toWO#3’s vehicle appears to have been of significant force and impact, and during the subsequent police pursuit, at high speeds, which covered a fair distance with numerous involved police vehicles all with lights and sirens activated, appears suspicious at best.  I find it highly unlikely that the Complainant would have been oblivious to these fairly loud and forceful events.  Furthermore, the fact thatSO#2 observed the Complainant to exit through the driver’s door makes it more than likely that the Complainant was the actual driver of the stolen motor vehicle and therefore could not possibly have been oblivious to the police pursuit;The Complainant’s assertion that he simply walked away from the crashed motor vehicle and had no knowledge as to the presence of police, or that they wanted him, seems equally questionable, if not more so, especially in light of the fact that his fellow occupant of the stolen motor vehicle described him as running away in a bid to flee from police;The Complainant’s assertion that he heard no police commands to stop and give himself up is directly contradicted by the shouting of police officers to “Stop!” and “Get on the ground!”, which is evidenced on the recording as having been yelled extremely loudly;The Complainant’s assertion thatSO#1 stepped on his hand fracturing a bone appears questionable in light of the fact that neither the paramedics’ report, nor the Complainant’s medical records, indicate that he at any time made any mention of being injured by police, other than the dog bites, and, in fact, medical staff appeared to even be unaware of the injured hand until much later in the hospital visit, when the Complainant first indicated that his hand was hurting.  While there is no obligation on the Complainant to report any police abuse, I find it odd that he would not have mentioned to medical staff that a police officer had broken his hand; andInstead, I find it more likely that the Complainant’s hand was injured at some point, either in the vehicle collision, or when he fell to the ground when thePSDcaught up to him (as witnessed byCW#1), and he simply did not realize that his hand was broken until a later time, when he tried to piece the facts together to coincide with his injury.  I find that the opinion of the medical expert, with respect to the mechanism of this injury, as possibly being a fall, striking his hand on the ground, trying to punch the dog, or a compression injury from being stomped on or having his hand compressed between two hard surfaces, makes it very likely that either the car crash, or the fall, could have caused this injury.I have taken particular note that the Complainant does not allege thatSO#1 stomped on his hand, but only that he stepped on his hand when he, the Complainant, was trying to push off the dog.  Indeed, while I have serious concerns about the Complainant’s reliability and do not accept his version of events as accurate, even hadSO#1 stepped on his hand in order to stop the Complainant from fighting the dog, I would not find this to amount to an excessive use of force.  As indicated earlier, Canadian case law indicates that police officers, acting in the execution of their duties, are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety nor should they be judged to a standard of perfection.  As such, even were I to accept the Complainant’s version of events, which I find would be unwise given the amount of proven inconsistencies in his evidence, I would be unable to find that the evidence leaves me with reasonable grounds to believe thatSO#1 resorted to an excessive use of force on these facts.In conclusion, I find that all of the available reliable evidence, with respect to all three distinct areas of the police interaction with the Complainant, leaves me without reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer involved in the pursuit and subsequent apprehension and arrest of the Complainant acted outside of the limits of the criminal law.  As such, as I lack the necessary bases for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	January 28, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=216
,Kingston Police,Belleville,Ontario,The injuries to Complainant 2 could not be confirmed as he refused to consent to the release of his medical records,"During the course of this investigation, 19 civilian and 11 police witnesses were interviewed; the police witnesses also provided their memorandum book notes to theSIUinvestigators for review.  The two designated subject officers,SO#1 andSO#2, who were leading the pursuit at the time of the ultimate collision, declined to be interviewed or to provide their notes for review, as is their legal right.In addition to the witnesses interviewed,SIUinvestigators had access to, and reviewed, numerousCCTVvideos from commercial premises en route, the recordings of the 911 call and police transmissions, the accident reconstruction report, and an abundance of raw data from the involved motor vehicles, all of which was thoroughly reviewed and resulted in a time/distance analysis of each of the involved motor vehicles at various points plotted along the route of the pursuit which culminated in the collision with Complainant #1’s motor vehicle in the Town of Napanee.  Despite neither Complainant #2, nor the two subject officers, consenting to an interview, a clear picture of events was able to be pieced together from the abundance of information gathered.  There is no dispute as to the facts.The following narrative was derived from all of the gathered evidence during the course of this investigation:TheOPPreceived a 911 call fromCW#11 at 3:32 p.m. on March 6, 2018.  In the call,CW#11 reported seeing a greySUVdriving on the wrong side of the road in order to pass a line-up of motor vehicles stopped for a stop sign on Highway 2 at Shannonville Road, in the Community of Shannonville, west of the Town of Napanee.CW#11 went on to report that the vehicle then drove through a stop sign, without stopping, and travelled at approximately 200 km/h, before proceeding eastbound on Highway 2.At 3:32:24 p.m., the dispatcher sent out a radio transmission to allOPPunits advising of the complaint and providing a description of the suspect vehicle.  Various police units immediately responded that they would assist in attempting to locate the vehicle.At 3:43:30 p.m.,SO#2 broadcast that she was behind a vehicle matching the description of theSUVwhich had been complained about, which she described as travelling into the Town of Napanee on County Road 1.SO#2 provided the licence plate number and advised that it was her intention to stop the vehicle at Jim Kimmett Boulevard.SO#2 further advised that she was going to stop the vehicle because it was all over the road and driving at inconsistent speeds.At 3:44:06 p.m.,SO#2 requested the assistance of another unit because, she indicated, theSUVhad “just passed a car dangerously on the corner.  Coming up to a high school zone, he’s just taken off on me.”Shortly after 3:44:38 p.m.,WO#3 reported that, “He just tried to hit me head-on on the bridge,”SO#2 broadcast that theSUVwas taking cars ‘head-on’, andSO#1, at 3:45:15 p.m., reported that, “He’s purposely trying to hit people head-on here.”At 3:45:40 p.m.,CCTVfrom the Market Entrance Intersection at Centre Street and Bridge Street West confirmed that theSUVwas by-passing the eastbound traffic on Bridge Street and entering the intersection against a red light, without stopping or slowing.SO#1 is then seen at 3:45:43 p.m., three seconds behind theSUV, with emergency lights activated, also travelling eastbound on Bridge Street, before stopping for the red light at Centre Street.  Five seconds behindSO#1,SO#2 is also seen driving in the same direction with her emergency lights activated, where she slows at the red light before proceeding through the intersection when it was safe to do so.  Third in the police vehicle line-up at that point,WO#3 is seen 15 seconds behindSO#2 and he too stopped at the red light at Centre Street, before proceeding.At 3:45:47 p.m.,SO#2 broadcast that theSUVhad driven through the intersection of Bridge and Centre Streets against a red light.At 3:46:06 p.m.,CCTVfrom the Gibbard Furniture Store at 88 Dundas Street East revealed theSUVgoing through yet another red traffic signal at the intersection of Dundas and Bridge Streets.  At that point,SO#1 appears to be about six seconds behind theSUV, withSO#2 two seconds behindSO#1, followed byWO#2 and thenWO#9.At 3:46:11 p.m.,WO#3 broadcast a request to theOPPProvincial Communications Centre "">PCC that more units be set up to attempt to stop theSUV, and described the ongoing driving of theSUVas erratic, “He’s just trying to cause accidents.  He’s driving very dangerously.”At 3:46:20 p.m.,CCTVfrom Spring Side North Park revealed theSUVdriving along County Road 2, in an eastbound direction, at a high rate of speed, followed bySO#1, still four seconds behind, and thenSO#2,WO#2 andWO#9; neither the order of vehicles, nor their distance behind theSUV, appears to have changed from the previous video recording.At 3:46:39 p.m., in response to a request by the communications supervisor,WO#7, to clarify the reason for the police pursuit,WO#3 summarized, “It’s a traffic complaint, male driving over 200, driving erratically, not stopping at stop signs and he tried to hit me head-on.  He’s continued eastbound and he’s swerving at cars trying to causeMVCs (motor vehicle collisions),” at which pointSO#1 added, “He’s swerving towards oncoming vehicles.  He just hit one head-on … just … just by 8168!  Head-on collision!  There’s five cruisers with him.”Immediately thereafter,SO#1 andWO#3 consecutively requested the attendance of theEMSand an ambulance.The Crash Data Retrieval from Complainant #2’sSUVconfirms that five seconds prior to impact, Complainant #2 was travelling at 137 km/h and that he had not engaged his braking mechanism.  While his speed, as he approached Complainant #1’s vehicle, remained steady, within one to two km/h variations, at 2.5 seconds prior to impact, he began to accelerate, with his speed reaching 142 km/h, 0.5 seconds prior to impact, and the collision occurring at a speed of 138.0 km/h.  At no time prior to the collision, did Complainant #2 apply his brakes, with examination of the data revealing rather that he had the gas pedal compressed to maximum and accelerated at a constant slight increase, up to and including, the moment of collision.Furthermore, analysis of the steering wheel angle data revealed that just prior to impact, the steering wheel was turned to the left, into oncoming traffic and into collision with the vehicle being operated by Complainant #1, making the conclusion that the collision was, whether deliberate on Complainant #2’s part, inevitable.Examination of all of the police cruisers confirmed that at no time was any police vehicle involved in the collision.Unbeknownst to police at the time of the pursuit of theSUV, numerous other civilians had observed the erratic and often dangerous driving of theSUV, with some observations occurring as early as 7:30 that morning, when theSUVwas observed to pass, in the oncoming lane of traffic, a line of vehicles which was stopped for a school bus which had its lights flashing and the stop sign arm out.  Other observations included erratic driving, varying unexplained decreases and increases in speed, veering on the roadway, excessive speeds, and an observation that the driver may have been under the influence of drugs.CW#11, the 911 caller, described observing theSUVtravelling at a high rate of speed approach and then pass, in the oncoming lane of traffic, a line-up of cars waiting at a red light.CW#11 further described theSUVas barely having missed striking her vehicle as it swerved into the oncoming lane of traffic to drive around her vehicle.  TheSUVthen entered the intersection, straddled along the centre of the intersection between the westbound and eastbound lanes, before speeding off at about 180 km/h in a 50 km/h zone.CW#10 observed theSUVtravelling eastbound on Belleville Road and go through the stop sign at Bridge Street West, without stopping, where it cut off a markedOPPvehicle.CW#10 described theSUVas then mounting the curb and travelling on the curb and the sidewalk, before returning to the roadway.CW#10 described the subjectSUVas driving erratically, at a high rate of speed, and not stopping for anything, including a red traffic signal at Bridge and Centre Streets, where it almost struck a red van.CW#10 also observed theSUVbeing pursued at that point by twoOPPpolice cruisers.CW#5 made similar observations to that ofCW#10, further indicating that she then observed two markedOPPvehicles, with lights and sirens activated, pursuing theSUV, at speeds of approximately 80 km/h;CW#5 estimated that these two cruisers were roughly six to seven car lengths behind theSUV.  She also observed that numerous other markedOPPvehicles then joined into the pursuit from intersecting streets.CW#4 was a passenger in a motor vehicle driving westbound on County Road 2, towards Napanee, behind a red Sebring.  He described seeing theSUVbeing pursued by eight police vehicles.  He indicated that the motor vehicle in which he was driving was pulling over to the shoulder of the road to allow theSUVand police vehicles to pass, when he observed theSUVdeliberately cross the centre line and travel in the oncoming lane of traffic, colliding head-on with the red Sebring, which had also slowed and was moving onto the shoulder, with the speed of theSUVbeing such that the collision caused the red Sebring to come off the ground about six feet, before coming to rest in the south ditch, and theSUVcoming off the ground, rotating counter clock-wise and coming to rest pointing westbound in the centre of the roadway.  This evidence is also fully consistent with the evidence ofWO#1 who described the red vehicle, the Sebring, as apparently observing the oncomingSUVand moving to the shoulder when theSUVintentionally lined up with the red vehicle, in a straight line, and hit the red vehicle head-on at full speed.WO#1 also noted that the driver of theSUVneither activated his brake lights, nor did he attempt to swerve out of the way of the red Sebring.The evidence of these witnesses is consistent with other civilian witnesses interviewed, with one witness,CW#13, specifically commenting that during the pursuit, she observed the first two of the police cruisers following theSUVto be very prudent, as they stopped at the red light, which Complainant #2 had driven through, and assessed the situation in the intersection before they proceeded into and through the intersection.All witnesses described the roads as being dry and, those who witnessed the actual pursuit, described a gap between the lead police vehicle and theSUV, with descriptions ranging, at various points throughout the pursuit, as being from six or seven car lengths (CW#5), 40 to 50 feet (CW#12), six car lengths (CW#18), two metres (CW#3), three to four car lengths (CW#13), at least two car lengths, or perhaps more (CW#19), ten seconds and a distance of one to one and one half miles (CW#16), or lastly, just prior to the collision, about three car lengths (CW#4).  As such, I accept as accurate the assessment ofWO#1 that the lead police vehicle did not tail-gate, or ‘push,’ theSUV, but rather travelled behind it with more than enough distance to react to the movement of theSUV.Furthermore, the actions of the police officers engaged in the pursuit were described by one witness (CW#13) as prudent, while a second (CW#7) described the cruisers as driving more slowly than theSUVand using some caution.Complainant #2 was then removed from his motor vehicle by police, with guns drawn.  He was described as being noticeably angry at the officers and was yelling and swearing at them.  Complainant #1 was pinned in her motor vehicle and, while still initially having vital signs, those quickly lapsed and she was pronounced dead at the scene, while still pinned inside her motor vehicle.  The damage to her motor vehicle, and to Complainant #1, was massive and overwhelming, as would be expected when hit head-on at the speed with which Complainant #2 slammed into her motor vehicle with his much largerSUV.With the exception of the two subject officers, all police officers involved in the pursuit provided statements toSIUinvestigators; I have not, however, recounted them here, as the evidence from the civilian witnesses, theCCTVfootage, the communications recordings, and the abundance of raw data from both the police vehicles and theSUVmake the sequence of events abundantly clear.  Suffice it to say that the evidence of the police witnesses is fully consistent and in accord with both the civilian witnesses and the physical evidence.Having reviewed all of the extensive evidence from the many civilian and police witnesses who observed Complainant #2’s driving on the afternoon of March 6, 2018, there is no question that Complainant #2 posed a real and imminent danger to the lives and/or safety of anyone who came within range of the vehicle that he was driving.  Unlike many other police pursuit investigations, this is not a matter of a police officer deciding whether to stop a motor vehicle in order to investigate the driver for anHTAoffence or to execute aCriminal Codewarrant, or to allow him to flee and to be arrested on another day.  Instead, it is clear that Complainant #2, before police ever came to either look for him, or to follow him, according to the many witnesses who came forward, and the recorded 911 call, posed a real and imminent threat to other motorists he encountered on the roadway that afternoon, and that police had no choice but to make every effort to stop him before he killed someone.  Unfortunately, before the police were able to effectively contain and stop Complainant #2, hisSUVdid indeed collide with the motor vehicle being operated by 88-year-old Complainant #1, killing her.It is clear from the police transmission recording that the police discussed and actually resorted to a number of strategic options to try to stop Complainant #2. The efforts includedSO#2’s initial attempt to bring Complainant #2 to a stop prior to the initiation of the pursuit,WO#3’s attempt to assist in the vehicle stop, which was met with Complainant #2 swerving into the oncoming lane of traffic and into a head-on collision position withWO#3’s cruiser, forcingWO#3 to swerve hard to his right towards the north shoulder to avoid colliding with theSUV, andWO#1 stopping his cruiser across the eastbound lane of Bridge Street West, at its intersection with Belleville Road, in order to force theSUVto a stop.  TheSUV, however then evaded his vehicle by turning the corner at a high rate of speed, on two wheels, not stopping for the stop sign, swerving aroundWO#1’s police vehicle at the last moment, mounting the sidewalk and a residential front lawn, before accelerating to a high rate of speed and continuing eastbound on Bridge Street.  Specifically,WO#1 also noted that he positioned his vehicle as he did because there was insufficient time available either to deploy a spike belt or to resort to any other alternate measures by which to stop the dangerous movements of theSUV.  All of the strategies resorted to by police, however, were unsuccessful due to the evasive actions of Complainant #2.  Furthermore, at the time of the collision, there had already been radio discussion with respect to the availability of police officers from the LoyalistOPPDetachment to block roads, intercept theSUV, or deploy a spike belt; unfortunately, there was insufficient time to put those additional alternative strategies into place prior to the fatal collision with Complainant #1’s vehicle.It is further evident, however, that police could not stand idly by and allow Complainant #2 to continue driving in the fashion that he was, while he put numerous other motorists and pedestrians at risk.While it is clear that eventually eight police cruisers, including the two lead vehicles manned bySO#1 andSO#2, were all engaged in a vehicular pursuit of Complainant #2, it is equally clear that they had few other options available to them in order to stop Complainant #2’s extremely frightening driving behaviour and to safeguard the citizens of the communities through which he was travelling.  Based on the evidence of various witnesses to Complainant #2’s driving, it was not a question of if, but when, Complainant #2 was going to seriously injure or kill someone.  It was the duty of the police officers to safeguard those communities, which they could not do without stopping Complainant #2, which, when all else failed, required a vehicular pursuit.I note that all of the officers involved in attempting to stop Complainant #2 did so in compliance with Ontario Regulation 266/10 of the OntarioPolice Services ActentitledSuspect Apprehension Pursuits, in that they notified and were in constant contact with the communications centre, they constantly updated the dispatcher as to the location and speed of Complainant #2 and their own police vehicles, they resorted to alternative measures, other than a pursuit, to try and stop Complainant #2.  Further,WO#7, as the pursuit supervisor, was obviously assessing the determination made to initiate a pursuit when she asked the reason for the pursuit in order to determine whether or not to discontinue the pursuit and assess whether the risk to public safety that may result from the pursuit outweighed the risk to public safety that may result if an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle was not immediately apprehended; unfortunately, the ultimate collision occurred before either any alternative measures could be put into place, and before a determination to possibly discontinue the pursuit could be made.Despite each of the two subject officers declining to provide a statement, I have inferred their state of mind with respect to their assessment as to the risk to public safety from a number of their actions as follows:When Complainant #2 drove through the red signal lights at several intersections, despite the desire of the officers to stop Complainant #2, I conclude that they felt it was too dangerous to do so and each either came to a complete stop, or slowed and proceeded with caution, before entering the intersection[1];They considered alternative measures, including calling in the LoyalistOPPofficers to deploy a spike belt, block roads, intercept theSUV, or resort to other alternative measures, but there was insufficient time to put those options into play;They continuously communicated over the radio with respect to the location of Complainant #2 and sought assistance; and,The civilians who observed the pursuit described there always being a gap between the lead vehicle and theSUVand that the police vehicles were driving at a lesser speed than theSUV.Despite finding that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the two subject officers, and indeed the operators of all eight involved police vehicles, complied with theSuspect Apprehension Pursuit Policy, pursuant to the OntarioPolice Services Act, the question remains whether, on these facts, there are reasonable grounds to believe that any of the officers involved in the pursuit of Complainant #2 committed a criminal offence, specifically, whether or not the driving rose to the level of being dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249 (1) of theCriminal Codeand did thereby cause death (to Complainant #1) contrary to s. 249 (4) or bodily harm (to Complainant #2) contrary to s.249 (3), or if it amounted to criminal negligence contrary to s.219 of theCriminal Codeand did thereby cause death (s.220) or bodily harm (s.221).The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, defines s.249 as requiring that the driving be dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances”; while the offence under s.219 requires “a marked and substantial departure from the standard of a reasonable driver in circumstances” where the accused “showed a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others” (R. v. Sharp(1984), 12 CCC (3d) 428 Ont CA).I also find that while Complainant #2’s manner of driving posed an immediate and significant danger to others, both motorists and pedestrians, the evidence establishes that the dangerous nature of his driving preceded any involvement by police and that their pursuit of the vehicle which he was driving did not appear to exacerbate his driving, but rather he simply continued on in the same manner as he had already been reported to be driving, as evidenced in the 911 call and the statements of the various civilian witnesses interviewed, which preceded any involvement by police.Furthermore, I note that despite Complainant #2’s choice of entering at least one intersection against a red traffic signal, thereby interfering with other traffic,SO#1 specifically stopped before proceeding at that same controlled intersection, whileSO#2 slowed and proceeded with caution, in order to minimize the danger to other motorists.I am also unable to find any causal connection between the driving of Complainant #2 and the actions of police, in that it appears that the police pursuit did nothing to influence Complainant #2’s manner of driving and he simply carried on in the same dangerous and reckless manner in which he had already been driving before police began to pursue him.Additionally, while it is clear that the officers were, at times, all travelling at speeds in excess of the posted speed limit, I accept the assessment of the independent civilian witnesses that they were proceeding prudently and with relative caution and that they always kept a gap between the lead police vehicle and the subjectSUVand, further, I find that there is no evidence that the driving, by any of the police officers, created a danger to other users of the roadway or that they interfered with other traffic at any time.  Rather, I find that their driving posed a far lesser danger to other motorists than did the driving of Complainant #2.  In fact, it appears that they posed no danger at all in that the vehicles had already stopped and pulled over for Complainant #2’s motor vehicle prior to the arrival of police, and were therefore not influenced by the driving of the pursuing police cruisers.I fully accept the accuracy of the comments of several of the civilian witnesses, and as consistent with the police witnesses, that Complainant #2 was intentionally driving head-on into oncoming traffic and that (intentionally or not) he was going to kill someone if not stopped by police.  While I am unable, in the absence of some input from Complainant #2, to determine whether or not he deliberately intended to cause a loss of life by his manner of driving, it is clear that he had an utter disregard for the lives and safety of those with whom he came into contact and, if it was not his intent to deliberately kill someone, he was clearly reckless as to whether or not he caused a death, either with or without the involvement of police, and he showed an utter disregard for human life.On all of the evidence before me, I cannot find any connection between the actions of the police in attempting to stop Complainant #2, who was a clear and imminent danger to the lives of others, and the tragic loss of life of Complainant #1 or the injuries to Complainant #2 himself.  On this record, it is clear that Complainant #2 chose to drive in a manner which was dangerous to others and had no regard for the possible loss of life that his driving would inevitably lead to, both before and after he came to the attention of police.  I have no hesitation in finding that had police never intervened and attempted to stop Complainant #2, there is still a very strong likelihood that he would have killed at least one person, if not many more.While it is unfortunate that police were unable to stop Complainant #2 before the tragic death of Complainant #1, on all of the evidence, I accept that the two subject officers, and all of the officers who attempted to bring Complainant #2 to a stop, used their best efforts in what was a very fast-paced and dynamic situation, with little time for planning out strategies. Unfortunately however, their efforts were not enough to stop Complainant #2, who appeared intent on causing as much harm as possible.I find on this evidence that the driving of the police officers involved in the pursuit and the attempt to apprehend Complainant #2 does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute ‘a marked departure from the norm’ and even less so ‘a marked and substantial departure from the norm’ and there is no evidence to establish any causal connection between the actions of the pursuing officers and the motor vehicle collision that tragically took the life of Complainant #1.  As such, I find that there is no evidence upon which I can form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed by any of the police officers in their efforts to stop Complainant #2, and therefore there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.Date:	January 28, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=212

Regrettably, this left little eyewitness evidence as to what occurred in the seconds leading up to, and including, the collision which resulted in the Complainant’s death.WO#1, in his interview, recounted that after the surveillance team had made sufficient observations to satisfy themselves that they had reasonable grounds to believe that the five suspect parties were involved in a joint venture for which they were arrestable for mischief to property (section 430) and theft (section 334) contrary to theCriminal Code,WO#2 made the call that the parties were to be arrested by the team.[3]WO#1 recalled then observing the Complainant on the sidewalk of Kennedy Road walking northbound.  Since it was the Complainant whoWO#1 believed had just committed the thefts, and was likely carrying the evidence of the crime on his person, he decided to continue surveillance on the Complainant.WO#1 observed the Complainant approach one of the two involved motor vehicles, the grey Hyundai Tucson, but not enter the vehicle.  At that point,WO#1 opined that the involved parties were aware of the police presence as the Tucson drove away northbound on Kennedy Road, leaving the Complainant behind standing on the sidewalk.WO#1 indicated that he decided at that time to arrest the Complainant, as he had reasonable grounds to do so.[4]WO#1 then drove up to the east Kennedy Road sidewalk, ten to 15 feet behind where the Complainant was walking.WO#1 recalled that his intention at that time was to exit his vehicle and use the vehicle as safety cover between himself and the Complainant, while he directed the Complainant that he was under arrest.WO#1 advised that he wished to use his motor vehicle as cover because: he was unaware as to whether or not the Complainant had anything on his person by which he could harmWO#1; he was aware that the Complainant had just punctured the tire of a motor vehicle and therefore possibly possessed a sharp object; and,WO#1 observed a pointed silver object in the Complainant’s front jeans pocket. BeforeWO#1 had the opportunity to exit his vehicle, however, the Complainant looked directly atWO#1, following which he turned and ran southbound along the sidewalk, throwing something over an abutting fence as he did so.WO#1 proceeded to drive onto the sidewalk with his motor vehicle and follow the Complainant.  This evidence is confirmed by theCCTVfootage obtained from aYRTbus that was driving in the area and which captured this portion of the incident.  According to theCCTVfootage, at 4:30:52 p.m., the Toyota Camry operated byWO#1 made a U-turn at the intersection of Kennedy Road and Second Street, following which it drove southeast toward the east sidewalk of Kennedy Road, and then started to travel southbound along the sidewalk.  At 4:31:03 p.m., a man dressed in black, believed to be the Complainant, is seen on the east sidewalk in front ofWO#1’s Toyota Camry.WO#1’s justification for driving on the sidewalk was that it was the safest option available to him since his driving on the road, while trying to continue to watch the Complainant, would have created a hazard to other drivers and could have resulted in a collision or other interference with traffic as his attention would have been focused on the Complainant, and not on his driving or other traffic.  Additionally,WO#1 considered that there was a “football field” of open space in front of him to deal with whatever events arose; no other pedestrians were on the sidewalk; no vehicles or persons were seen to be entering or exiting the Petro Canada station at the northeast corner of the Kennedy Road and Highway 7 intersection; and, no vehicles were coming northbound on Kennedy and southbound traffic was stopped.  As such,WO#1 determined that it was safe for him to follow and observe the Complainant all the way to the gas station, which would allow him to direct other officers as to the Complainant’s location, to re-engage the Complainant once he reached the gas station, and to continue to use his car as cover should the Complainant still be in possession of any possible weapons.WO#1 relied on his training, which had taught him to not get out of his vehicle and not to get too close to the person, in case he had a weapon, and to use his best source for cover, that being his motor vehicle, as there was nothing else available forWO#1 to use as cover.WO#1 concluded that the safest way to apprehend the Complainant without interfering with the public was to drive in a direct line so that he could drive safely while keeping the Complainant in his line of sight, and then call for further assistance, when necessary, to arrest the Complainant.WO#1 drove south along the sidewalk maintaining his speed at under 20 km/h and never closing the gap between himself and the Complainant to less than 30 feet.  He described the Complainant as starting to run after he had thrown the item or items over the fence.  As he approached a cement utility pole, the Complainant started to slow, as didWO#1 as he neared the Complainant.WO#1 then described the Complainant as swinging himself around the pole and onto the roadway, where he continued to run as he looked northward.WO#1 next saw the Complainant after he had been struck by theSO’s Volkswagen.WO#1 could not describe the impact and was unable to explain why he did not witness the collision.DespiteCW#3’s refusal to provide a statement toSIUinvestigators, in her 911 call,CW#3 is recorded as telling the 911 call taker that she had witnessed the entire incident in which a person had been run over by a car.  She stated that the man, “was running and a car hit him.  He crossed the street suddenly, so he was running from a car that was running after him and he crossed the street.”  The three other 911 callers simply advised that they had heard, but not seen, the collision, with one caller,CW#5, reporting that she had heard a “screeching” sound lasting some three to four seconds, which she described as being similar to the sound made when “someone slams on their brakes.”Additionally,CW#3 is recorded, on theICCSof a police cruiser, tellingWO#12, a uniformed officer who responded to the 911 calls, that she had observed the injured man running and she had seen him throw something long and black over a fence.  She then observed that the man was running away from someone and that there was a black car coming.[5]The conclusions of theSIUCollision Reconstructionist revealed that: the Complainant was struck in the middle of the northbound passing lane and that he was struck by the right front of the Volkswagen Passat operated by theSO; the Complainant had likely been moving in a diagonal (southwest) direction in the moments prior to impact and had possibly been on the roadway for approximately two seconds before the impact occurred; the Volkswagen was traveling southbound at a speed of approximately 50 km/h just prior to impact; and, the Volkswagen had steered hard to the left, just before impact, and then steered hard to the right, just after impact.   Additionally, the Toyota Camry operated byWO#1 had been traveling at no more than 10 to 15 km/h when it exited the sidewalk and drove onto the grass boulevard.The offences that arise for consideration are dangerous driving causing death and criminal negligence causing death contrary to sections 249(4) (presently, section 320.13(3)) and 220 of theCriminal Code, respectively. With respect to the former, the driving must be dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place.  Moreover, the driving must be such that it amounts to a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the circumstances: R v Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49.  Section 220 requires “a marked and substantial departure from the standard of a reasonable driver in circumstances” where the accused “showed a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others”: R v Sharp (1984), 12 CCC (3d) 428 (Ont. C.A).  While there are aspects of theSO’s conduct that are open to scrutiny, I am satisfied on balance that he operated his vehicle within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  One may, for example, question the wisdom of the officer maneuvering his vehicle into oncoming lanes of traffic just before the impact with the Complainant.  In the absence of a statement from the officer, it is reasonable to infer that theSOmay have done so in an effort to prevent the Complainant’s flight from police much asWO#1 used his vehicle to follow the Complainant.  Were this the case, the officer’s decision was associated with a clear risk of harm to the Complainant given their respective vulnerabilities at the time.  One also wonders why theSOdid not activate his emergency lights and siren as he proceeded south on Kennedy Road toward the point of impact.  Had he done so, the Complainant may have been alerted to his presence and taken steps to avoid colliding with the vehicle.On the other hand, I accept the statements made byCW#3, during her 911 call and repeated thereafter toWO#12, as both reliable and trustworthy, and accept that the Complainant “was running and a car hit him. He crossed the street suddenly …”CW#3’s statements were made shortly after the collision in question in circumstances where there is no reason to believe they are anything other than credible and reliable.  Additionally, based on the findings of the collision reconstructionist, I find that theSOwas travelling at no more than 50 km/h in the moments prior to the collision and that the Complainant had only been on the roadway for approximately two seconds at the time he was struck.  I also accept as reliable the evidence fromCW#5’s 911 call that she heard a vehicle apparently brake hard prior to the impact; and, the finding that the Volkswagen steered hard to the left prior to the impact, and hard to the right after impact.  This leads me to believe that theSOresponded to the sudden appearance of the Complainant by both braking and swerving to avoid striking him.  Combined with the evidence that the weather on that day was dry and slightly overcast and that, at the time of the impact, there was little traffic on the road northbound, and southbound traffic was stopped at the light, I have concluded that the evidence falls short of leaving me with reasonable grounds to believe that theSO’s driving rose to the level of driving required to constitute a marked departure from a reasonable level of care when the Complainant “suddenly” ran out into the roadway and was struck by theSO’s motor vehicle.As such, I find that there is insufficient evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed.  Accordingly, this file is closed.Date:	May 13, 2019Original signed byJoseph MartinoInterim DirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=331
,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,u2003\nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant underwent a CT scan and it was determined that he had sustained a fractured right orbital bone bone in the eye socket,"Once the two motor vehicles had left the parking lot, with nothing else going on, theSOandWO#1 decided to re-locate to another area to carry out surveillance for any possible illegal activities andWO#1 drove their unmarked police vehicle out of the parking lot, eventually ending up on Annabelle Drive.  As they drove down Annabelle Drive, the police officers observed the same Toyota motor vehicle that had been in the parking lot.  The Toyota had apparently been involved in a single vehicle collision with a tree in front of a residence on Annabelle Drive.WO#1 pulled over his police vehicle and both officers exited with theSOapproaching the driver of the Toyota, the Complainant, whileWO#1 spoke to a civilian witness,CW#1, who had apparently come out of his home to assist when he heard the collision.  Following the arrest of the Complainant, he was observed to be bleeding from his head/facial area and he was transported to hospital where aCTscan revealed that the orbital bone on the right side of his face had been fractured; the Complainant also received four stitches in the area of his right ear lobe, which was obviously the source of any bleeding at the scene.  Additionally, the Complainant complained that he had a chipped tooth on the right side of his face and that his teeth had been pushed back, for which he was referred to a dentist for follow-up.According to the Complainant, on February 25, 2018, he purchased takeout food and was driving home when the food, which was on the front passenger seat, fell over and he lost control of his car and hit a tree, causing the driver side airbag to deploy.  The Complainant indicated that he briefly lost consciousness for one second, and then jumped out of the car.  He described the only injury received by him as a result of the collision as being a minor strain to his neck, but no injuries to his face, and no bleeding.The Complainant then described theSOandWO#1 arriving and identifying themselves as police officers.  TheSOasked the Complainant if he was impaired and grabbed his right hand and placed it on the hood of the police vehicle; theSOthen told the Complainant to place his left hand on the hood.  The Complainant indicated that theSOtold him that the police had observed the Complainant when he got in and out of another car at the restaurant and that is why they followed him.  The Complainant, however, does not assert that the police ever pursued him or that they were in any way responsible for his collision.The Complainant advised that theSOthen began to search him, causing the Complainant to run away because he had a package of drugs on him, although he could not recall what the drugs were.  The Complainant only managed to run a short distance however, when theSOtackled him and he landed face first on the right side of his face on a paved driveway.  He alleges that theSOsmacked the right side of his face into the pavement.The Complainant claimed that he did not resist, but kept repeating that he did not want to go to jail.  He described theSOas being on his back and pressing his (theSO’s) left forearm down on top of the left side of the Complainant’s face, which then caused the right side of his face to make contact with the paved surface.  When the Complainant tried to lift his head up, someone, he assumed theSObut he could not actually see who it was, punched him numerous times on the right side of his face.  The Complainant advised that he told the doctor at the hospital that his injury was not caused by the collision, but later, at the police station, because he was scared, he told the sergeant (presumably the booking sergeant) that his injury was as a result of the collision.Despite the Complainant’s statement as to what he told the doctor as to the cause of his injury, I note that the version of events as noted in his medical records, the source of which is the Complainant himself and theEMS, indicates the following:Pt. (patient) driving his car and reached for food on the passenger seat.  Ran into a tree, both airbag deployed and pt. sustained R ear, R eye and facial trauma.  Blood in his mouth and tooth pushed back.  Pt. blew his nose and air pocket noted under eye with possible sinus injury.According toCW#1, a totally independent and uninvolved third party, he heard the collision and then observed the Complainant get out of the driver’s door of the Toyota.CW#1 approached the Complainant and asked him several times if he was okay; the Complainant appeared dazed and confused, and took his cellphone and threw it on the ground, advisingCW#1 that he had been looking at his cellphone and subsequently struck the tree.CW#1 did not observe any injuries to the Complainant at that time.CW#1 then observed that within one to two minutes after the collision, theSOandWO#1 arrived at the collision scene and theSOapproached the Complainant, identified himself as a police officer, and showed his badge by way of identification.  TheSOasked the Complainant if he was okay and asked him to walk over to the police vehicle.CW#1 heard theSOask the Complainant if he had consumed any drugs or alcohol and the Complainant replied in the negative.  TheSOthen directed the Complainant to empty his pockets, but the Complainant kept his left hand in his pocket. TheSOrepeated his request a number of times, with no compliance by the Complainant.CW#1 described the Complainant then running away from theSO, southbound on Annabelle Drive, and theSOandWO#1 pursuing him on foot.CW#1 described theSOtackling the Complainant from behind, within about 10 to 15 feet, indicating that theSOlunged and grabbed at the Complainant, and both fell to the ground beside a parkedSUVon Annabelle Drive.CW#1 described hearing a distinctive sound, as if something had struck metal, and he believed that the Complainant may have struck theSUVas he fell to the ground.Once down,CW#1 described the Complainant as resisting the officers, and heard the officers tell him several times to stop.  The Complainant, while initially refusing to drop whatever he had in his hand, was then seen to drop a bag of cocaine onto the driveway.WhenWO#1 then held the Complainant down on the ground on his stomach, and placed his hands behind his back, theSOwas able to handcuff him.  The Complainant was then sat up by the police officers, andCW#1 again had an opportunity to observe the Complainant’s face.  He described the Complainant as looking as if he had been tackled, with his hair all over the place, but he still observed no visible injuries.CW#1 indicated that neither theSO, norWO#1, delivered any strikes or kicks to the Complainant, nor did they resort to any of their use of force options.CW#1, who had experience in the military, was of the opinion that the force used by the officers to arrest the Complainant was completely acceptable.Contrary to the evidence ofCW#1, however,CW#2, another civilian in the area, while not observing the arrest of the Complainant, described seeing him half sitting/half lying in the corner ofCW#2’s driveway near hisSUV.  UnlikeCW#1,CW#2 observed that the Complainant had blood running down his arm and hand onto the ground, but he could not see the source of the blood.CW#2 never saw any police officer with his hands on the Complainant.On the basis, then, thatCW#1 did not see injuries to the Complainant either after he exited his vehicle, or after his arrest, I cannot find his evidence as being conclusive that the Complainant was not already injured as a result of the collision, as it is clear that the Complainant was clearly injured at some point, and he was bleeding heavily while on the ground at the foot ofCW#2’s driveway, based on the blood located on the driveway and as seen byCW#2.Based on this evidence, then, I note that it is as possible that the Complainant was injured in the motor vehicle collision, as he told medical staff at the hospital, as it is that his injuries were sustained when he was punched in the face while on the ground, of which there is no mention by the Complainant in his medical records.Equally possible, however, is that the Complainant fractured his orbital bone when he was tackled to the ground by theSOand he either struck the side of theSUVparked in the driveway where he was taken to the ground, as indicated byCW#1, or the right side of his face struck the driveway, as indicated by the Complainant himself.Finally, it may well be that the Complainant’s injuries were a combination of events, with his orbital bone fracture having occurred during the collision and deployment of the airbag, while the laceration to his ear was caused when he was tackled to the ground.  I find this last scenario is supported by the following facts: the Complainant described the collision as so severe as to cause him to momentarily lose consciousness; neither theSOnorCW#1 saw the Complainant bleeding after he exited the car and before he was tackled to the ground; theSOobserved that the Complainant already had red marks and swelling to the right side of his face before he ran off; the photos of the interior of the vehicle do not appear to reveal any blood on the airbag; and the Complainant was clearly bleeding at the time that he was down on the ground, as witnessed byCW#2 and theSO, and as evidenced by the blood located on the pavement.With respect to the Complainant’s credibility, I note that there were several inconsistencies between his statement to the civilian witness at the scene, his comments to medical staff at the hospital, and his statement toSIUinvestigators, which made him a less than reliable witness.  Among those inconsistencies were thatCW#1 indicated that the Complainant told him that the cause of the accident was that he was looking at his cellphone, which also appears consistent with theSO’s evidence wherein he indicated that the Complainant told him that he had dropped his cellphone and was trying to pick it up; his medical records indicate that he was reaching for his food on the passenger seat; and, his statement toSIUinvestigators indicated that his food fell over causing him to lose control of the car.Additionally, while the Complainant claimed to have lost consciousness immediately following the collision, I note that his medical records indicate that he indicated no loss of consciousness.  Another inconsistency between the evidence of the Complainant and the independent civilian witness,CW#1, is the assertion by the Complainant that he never resisted police, whileCW#1 asserted that the Complainant was actively resisting police and that he heard one of the police officers tell the Complainant to stop resisting some three to four times.Finally, even were the Complainant’s credibility not a live issue in this matter, I note that he specifically attributes his injuries to being punched in the face several times by a person who he cannot identify because he could not see who was punching him, but he assumes was theSO.  Clearly, an assumption, not based on clear evidence, cannot lead to reasonable grounds to believe that the perpetrator of the alleged punches was theSO, and notWO#1.I have to admit that had theSOandWO#1 not provided statements to theSIUindicating that theSOdid indeed deliver several distractionary punches to the Complainant, while the Complainant and theSOwere on the ground and the Complainant was actively resisting his arrest, I would have found that no punches were ever delivered by either police officer, and that there was no other conclusion but to find that the Complainant was either injured in the collision, or when he was tackled to the ground and struck his face either on theSUVin the driveway, or on the pavement where he went down face first, striking the right side of his face, where all of his injuries were located.On the facts before me that are not in dispute, that being of a man involved in a collision who refuses to take his hand out of his pocket when directed to do so by police, then flees from police while being investigated and has to be tackled to the ground to avoid escape, and then continues to actively resist police, I would find pursuant to s. 25 (1) of theCriminal Code, which exempts a police officer from prosecution if he acted on reasonable grounds and used no more force than justified and necessary in the execution of a lawful duty,[1]that the actions of theSOwere both measured and proportionate to the resistance being put up by the Complainant and that the distractionary strikes delivered to the Complainant’s face and body, as conceded by theSO, while he continually commanded the Complainant to stop resisting, were both justified and necessary and did not amount to an excessive use of force on this record.  I find further support in this conclusion based on the eye witness evidence ofCW#1.In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.However, in the absence of any definitive evidence that the Complainant’s injuries were caused by police, as opposed to the collision, with the medical records clearly indicating that they were proceeding on the basis of the Complainant’s statement to them that his injuries were indeed caused by the collision, I am unable to find reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer was responsible for the Complainant’s injuries.On the undisputed evidence, there is no question that the collision, if it was the cause of the serious injury, was in no way influenced or caused by police and therefore police could not have been responsible for the injury.On all of the evidence, I find that it is most likely that the Complainant was injured either during the collision, when his air bag deployed, or when he was tackled to the ground, while trying to escape and struck the right side of his face on the pavement.  Based on the evidence ofCW#1, I reject the Complainant’s evidence that he was repeatedly punched in the face by a police officer who he cannot identify, thereby causing his injuries.In conclusion, on the record before me, I find that the evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSOresorted to an excessive use of force in tackling a fleeing male to the ground, and then delivering a number of distractionary strikes in order to stop his resistance and place him in handcuffs.Nor does the evidence leave me with reasonable grounds to believe that there is a causal connection between the serious injury sustained by the Complainant and the actions of theSO, as opposed to the injury being the result of the motor vehicle collision.  As such, in theabsence of some definitive evidence as to the source of the Complainant’s injuries, I lack the necessary grounds upon which to lay criminal charges and none shall issue.Date:	January 15, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=200
,Ottawa Police Service,Ottawa,Ontario,The post-mortem examination was conducted on February 27 2018 and the cause of death was determined to be gunshot wounds to the chest,"There is no question that the Complainant was killed when he was shot by theSOand the focus of theSIU’s investigation revolved around what precipitated the shooting and whether the use of lethal force was justified. TheSOprovided theSIUwith a statement, and ten civilian witnesses and seven witness officers were also interviewed. The notes of 28 officers, including the subject officer, were also obtained and reviewed, along with theCCTVvideo from the Metro grocery store and the police radio communications. TheSIUalso obtained various forensic reports including the Complainant’s post-mortem and toxicology report, and a report about potential biology tracings on the knife.[5]From an extensive and careful review of this evidence, the facts leading up to the Complainant’s death are predominately clear. While no independent witness purported to see the entirety of what happened in the walkway, theSO’s statement is corroborated in part by the other witnesses, at or near the scene, and I believe he is a credible witness. After a review of the jurisprudence, and for the following reasons, I am unable to form grounds to believe theSOcommitted a criminal offence in relation to the Complainant’s death and believe that his use of force fell within the scope of that permitted by law.The Complainant first came to the attention of the OPS on February 25, 2018, at 6:48 p.m., when multiple people called 911 to report a stabbing in a Metro grocery store in Ottawa. The stabbing was clearly caught on the store’s surveillance cameras, which depicted the Complainant followingCW#7 around the store before chasing him with a knife. The Complainant caught up withCW#7 and stabbed him in the left side before fleeing the store on foot.[6]One 911 caller reported that he went eastbound on Wellington Street.At 6:52 p.m., several OPS officers attended the Metro grocery store, includingWO#1,WO#2,WO#3,WO#5 andWO#7. The officers were advised byCW#10 that he had seen the Complainant go into a nearby home that was under construction. At 7:05 p.m., this information was broadcasted over the police radio.TheSOwas en route to the stabbing incident when he heard over the radio about the Complainant’s whereabouts. He, along with several other OPS officers, attended the scene.CW#10 also returned to the area and pointed the officers to the garage of a nearby home.WO#4 went towards the garage, followed byWO#7,WO#1,WO#2 andWO#5. TheSOheaded toward the rear of the house through a walkway between two houses.[7]TheSOhad already drawn his firearm because he was aware that he was looking for an armed suspect.The confrontation between theSOand the Complainant occurred in the walkway between the two houses. TheSOdescribed the walkway as 50 feet long and about five feet wide. The lighting was poor and the ground was covered by snow and ice.[8]TheSOused the flashlight mounted on his firearm to provide light. After theSOwalked about 15 steps into the walkway he reportedly heard a “battle cry” and stopped walking. He advised theSIUthat he saw the Complainant jump down from an open porch at the back of the house that was under construction and land about five feet in front him.[9]The Complainant had a knife in his right hand which he was holding at shoulder height. TheSOyelled at the Complainant to drop the knife but the Complainant charged towards him. The Complainant had reportedly taken two steps and was about four feet away when theSOdischarged his firearm three times at the Complainant. TheSOsaid he stopped shooting when the Complainant stopped advancing towards him. The Complainant bent over and backed up slightly after he was shot, then reportedly stood back up and stepped toward theSOagain. TheSOfired another two or three rounds and the Complainant fell to the groundTheSO’s statement is supported by one civilian witness who saw part of the incident and several witnesses who heard it.[10]WO#4 is the only other witness who purports to have seen part of the incident. He described hearing a male’s voice yelling incomprehensibly while he attended to the garage. AsWO#4 walked around the garage he saw a flashlight and heard gunshots. He protected himself behind the garage and when there was a pause in the gunshots looked around the corner, yelling [an expression indicating the presence of police] to warn that police officers were in the line of fire. As he did so, he observed the Complainant crouched or half kneeling. He had his right hand extended and there was an object in his hand. There were more gunshots andWO#1 saw a muzzle flash. He asked theSOif the Complainant was down and theSOsaid he was.After the shooting, several OPS officers attended the walkway and saw theSOpointing his firearm at the Complainant, who was on the ground.WO#2 reported that theSOwas about three feet from the Complainant.WO#6 said theSOwas still shouting commands at the Complainant and that he observed a knife a couple of inches from the Complainant’s hands.WO#6 used his foot to move the knife away from the Complainant.WO#4 then also picked up the knife and placed it on the ground further away from the Complainant before doing a quick pat down search of the Complainant.WO#4 andWO#7 beganCPRon the Complainant. Paramedics arrived and the police carried the Complainant out of the alleyway and put him on a stretcher. The Complainant was transported to the OCH where he was pronounced dead.A post-mortem examination was performed on the Complainant’s body and the forensic pathologist concluded that the Complainant died of bullet wounds to the chest. There were a total of six bullet wounds found: three to the chest, one to the hip and one to each forearm. One of the bullet wounds to the forearm lined up with a bullet wound to the chest, suggesting that they were caused by the same bullet which hit the Complainant’s forearm before it stuck him in the chest. The direction of the bullets that struck the Complainant’s chest and hip was determined to be front to back and downward.[11]The Law and AnalysisIn my opinion, there is no evidence capable of supporting grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence. The uncontradicted evidence establishes that the Complainant aggressively proceeded towards theSOwith a knife. Thus, in my opinion, given the circumstances that existed and were known to him, theSOwas justified in using lethal force against the Complainant pursuant to s. 25(1) and (3) of theCriminal Code.To begin, I believe that theSOis a credible and reliable witness, and accept that the Complainant charged at him with a knife as alleged. TheSO’s statement to theSIUwas straightforward, detailed and was corroborated, in part, by the other witnesses, including a civilian witness who saw part of the incident.WO#4 also glimpsed the Complainant between the two rounds of gunshots and described observing the Complainant in a crouched position with an object in his right hand. Several other witnesses also heard the altercation and the majority of that evidence supports theSO’s statement that he yelled at the Complainant and that he fired one round of bullets followed by a second round in rapid succession.The indisputable fact that the Complainant charged at and stabbedCW#7 with a knife in the Metro grocery store[12]for no apparent reason shortly before his encounter with theSOinforms my belief that the Complainant would not have hesitated to similarly attack theSO.  While evidence of a propensity for violence is typically not admissible against an accused in a criminal trial, inRegina v. Scopelliti[1981] O.J. No. 3157 (C.A.), the Court of Appeal for Ontario confirmed that evidence of a complainant’s propensity for violence is relevant where self-defence is an issue. The Court stated:[T]here is impressive support for the proposition that, where self-defence is raised, evidence of the deceased’s character (i.e. disposition) for violence is admissible to show the probability of the deceased having been the aggressor and to support the accused’s evidence that he was attacked by the deceased.Less than an hour before the Complainant is alleged to have charged at theSOwith a knife, he – without being provoked – stabbedCW#7 with a knife. Charging at theSOwith a knife is a logical continuation of such violence. In the absence of any evidence contradicting theSO’s statement, I find that the Complainant charged at theSOas alleged.Having found that the Complainant charged at theSOwith a knife, it is my opinion that theSOwas permitted to use lethal force under ss. 25(1) and 25(3) of theCriminal Code. Section 25(1) governs the ability of police officers to use force during the course of their duties and states that a police officer is justified, if he or she acts on reasonable grounds, in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty. Section 25(3) imposes additional prerequisites where an officer uses lethal force as follows:(3) … a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.Therefore, theSOwas only permitted to use force against the Complainant if he was acting in the execution of a lawful duty, on reasonable grounds and used no more force than was necessary. Furthermore, pursuant to s. 25(3) of theCriminal Code, theSOwas only permitted to use force likely to cause death – i.e. to discharge his firearm at the Complainant – if he believed on reasonable grounds that using lethal force was necessary in order to preserve himself or others from death or grievous bodily harm.Turning to the first requirement of s. 25(1), it is clear that theSOwas acting in the course of his lawful duties when he was first encountered by the Complainant. The OPS officers clearly had reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant had at the very least committed the offence of assault with a weapon contrary to s. 267 of theCriminal Codeand that he was in possession of a weapon dangerous to the public, contrary to s. 88 of theCriminal Code. I am accordingly satisfied that the attempted apprehension of the Complainant was legally justified in the circumstances.The other requirements of s. 25(1) of theCriminal Coderequire an assessment of the necessity and reasonableness of the force used by theSO. In making this assessment, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, which states:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J. A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211(B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]The court describes the test required under s.25 as follows:Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances. That is not the end of the matter. Section 25(3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force, i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily harm. The officer's belief must be objectively reasonable. This means that the use of force under s. 25(3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis (Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).The decision of Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice inChartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada above, sets out other relevant provisions of theCriminal Codeto be considered, as follows:27. 	Use of force to prevent commission of offence - Everyone is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary(a)	to prevent the commission of an offence(i) for which, if it were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and(ii) that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone, or(b)	to prevent anything being done that, on reasonable grounds, he believes would, if it were done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).This Section, therefore, authorizes the use of force to prevent the commission of certain offenses. “Everyone"" would include a police officer. The force must not be more than that which is reasonably necessary. Therefore, an objective test is called for. The Ontario Court of Appeal, inR. v. Scopelliti(1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 held that the use of deadly force can be justified only in either cases of self-defence or in preventing the commission of a crime likely to cause immediate and serious injury.34(1) 	Self-defence against unprovoked assault - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him to defend himself.(2)	Extent of justification - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified if(a)	he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and(b)	he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.In order to rely on the defence under subsection (2) of Section 34, a police officer would have to demonstrate that he/she was unlawfully assaulted and caused death or grievous bodily harm to the assaulter in repelling the assault. The police officer must demonstrate that he or she reasonably apprehended that death or grievous bodily harm would result to him or her and that he or she, again on reasonable grounds, believed that he/she could not otherwise preserve himself/herself from death or grievous bodily harm. Again, the use of the term “reasonable” requires the application of an objective test.The court also sets out a number of other legal principles gleaned from the legal precedents cited, including the following:a)	Whichever section of theCriminal Codeis used to assess the actions of the police, the Court must consider the level of force that was necessary in light of the circumstances surrounding the event.b)	""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". The same applies to the use of force in making an arrest or preventing an escape. Like the driver of a vehicle facing a sudden emergency, the policeman ""cannot be held to a standard of conduct which one sitting in the calmness of a court room later might determine was the best course."" (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).c)	Police officers perform an essential function in sometimes difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. The police must not be unduly hampered in the performance of that duty. They must frequently act hurriedly and react to sudden emergencies. Their actions must therefore be considered in the light of the circumstances.d)	""It is both unreasonable and unrealistic to impose an obligation on the police to employ only the least amount of force which might successfully achieve their objective. To do so would result in unnecessary danger to themselves and others. They are justified and exempt from liability in these situations if they use no more force than is necessary, having regard to their reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers in which they find themselves"" (Levesque v. Zanibbi et al.).On the basis of the foregoing principles of law, I must therefore determine:(1)	Whether theSOsubjectively believed that he was at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant at the time that he discharged his firearm; and(2)	Whether that belief was objectively reasonable, or, in other words, whether his actions would be considered reasonable by an objective bystander who had all of the information available to him that theSOhad at the time that he discharged his firearm.It is clear from theSO’s statement that the first criteria is satisfied. TheSOtold theSIUthat he was aware the Complainant had already stabbed someone and that he feared for his safety. He felt that the Complainant was going to stab him and that he was unable to escape because he was in a confined space and the ground was slippery from the ice. He initially fired three rounds but then stopped because the Complainant stopped advancing towards him. In other words, he stopped using lethal force when he believed the risk of death or grievous bodily harm had passed. TheSOsaid he only shot the second round of bullets at the Complainant when he advanced towards him again and the risk of harm rematerialized. TheSOalso said he felt he had no choice but to shoot the Complainant because he had no time to switch from his firearm to his conducted energy weapon.Having carefully considered the facts as I have found them, I believe it is similarly evident that theSO’s belief that the Complainant was going to stab him was objectively reasonable. At that time theSOencountered the Complainant, theSOknew that the Complainant had just stabbed a man and was capable of violence.Regina v. Scopelliti, cited above, makes it clear that knowledge of prior violent acts is relevant to the reasonableness of a person’s belief that they were at risk for harm. The Court stated:It is well established that where self-defence is raised, evidence not only of previous assaults by the deceased on the accused, but also previous acts of violence by the deceased, known to the accused, towards third persons, is admissible to show the accused’s reasonable apprehension of violence from the deceased. Evidence of the deceased’s reputation for violence, know to the accused, is admissible on the same principle.TheSOknew the Complainant had stabbedCW#7 and suddenly found himself within five feet of the Complainant, who was advancing on him with a knife. TheSOwas alone in a narrow slippery alleyway and had no practical route for escape due to the conditions of the pathway. The Complainant let out a cry[13]indicative of an intention for further violence, ignored commands to drop the knife and advanced towards theSOwith the knife raised. An objective bystander clearly would consider theSO’s belief that he was going to be stabbed reasonable due to these extremely difficult circumstances.In summary, I believe that theSOwas lawfully justified under ss. 25(1) and 25(3) of theCriminal Codewhen he shot the Complainant and therefore have no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted an offence in relation to the Complainant’s death. TheSOwas acting in the course of his lawful duties when he came upon the Complainant, who advanced upon him quickly with a knife raised in a narrow and icy alleyway. Why the Complainant charged at theSO(or stabbedCW#7 in the Metro) is unknown, but I am confident that the Complainant charged at the subject officer as alleged and that theSOhad no other option than to resort to his firearm to protect himself from serious bodily harm or death. Tragically, the result of theSO’s use of force was the Complainant’s death. However, as the use of force was justified, no charges will issue and the file will be closed.Date:	January 21, 2019Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=202

,Peterborough Police Service,Peterborough,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant was assessed and an ultrasound was performed which confirmed a full-thickness distal patellar tendon rupture patellar tendon rupture is the rupture of the tendon that connects the knee cap to the top portion of the shin bone as per www,"The Complainant then went on to make several derogatory and threatening comments to shelter staff, following which she went upstairs and went to bed.As a result of the call to the Peterborough Police Service (PPS), Witness Officer (WO) #1 andWO#3 were dispatched to the shelter.  While en route, the Complainant’s name was queried and it was discovered that she had been placed on court ordered conditions to reside with her surety at an address in Selwyn Ontario, and therefore her residency at the women’s shelter in Peterborough put her in contravention of the conditions of her release from custody.  This information provided the police officers with reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was breaching her release conditions and was therefore arrestable pursuant to s. 145 (3) of theCriminal Code(Failure to comply with Recognizance).During the course of this investigation, fiveCWs, in addition to the Complainant, three police witnesses, and the Subject Officer (SO), were interviewed.  While there were several assertions made by the Complainant which were contradicted by numerous other witnesses present, both civilian and police, which made her a less than reliable witness, the fact remains that the Complainant was injured during her interaction with police on February 23, 2018, requiring a determination of whether or not the injury was caused as a result of an excessive use of force by police.  The following narrative is based on the credible and reliable evidence obtained during the course of this investigation.Upon arrival at the shelter, shelter staff briefly spoke to the two police officers, filling them in on the details of what had occurred, before then escorting them upstairs to the Complainant’s room.  Upon entering the room, one of the police officers turned on the light and the Complainant was observed to be in bed.CW#1, in the presence of the police officers, told the Complainant that she had to leave the shelter. The Complainant refused to get out of bed and continued to sling offensive comments atCW#1.  The Complainant then asked theSOto leave the room, to which he replied that he could not do that; this is consistent with the evidence of both shelter staff and the police officers present.  While the Complainant claims that she did not wish to get out of bed because she was naked from the waist up, this is contradicted by the other four witnesses present, who all described the Complainant as wearing some clothing, but not her pants, and that both her breasts and genital area were covered.When theSOrefused to leave the room, which he indicated was due to safety concerns for the shelter staff and the second police officer present, the Complainant became upset, but eventually got out of bed and put her pants on, following which she threw a pen inCW#1’s direction, but missed, and continued on with the verbal abuse.  The Complainant was then escorted down the stairs and out of the shelter by the two police officers, while both staff members returned to the office.  At that time, the Complainant was being physically compliant, but verbally abusive and argumentative.The Complainant was then escorted out onto the porch area, where a few other residents had congregated, includingCW#5 with whom the Complainant had previously been engaged in a heated argument.  As the Complainant was led out onto the porch, she began to yell atCW#5 and tried to get away from the police officers in order to get atCW#5.The Complainant asserts, both in her statement toSIUinvestigators and in comments made to medical staff as noted in her medical records, that she simply lost her balance, due to being pulled down the stairs by the police officers, and reached out to grabWO#3, in order to avoid falling.  Several of the residents, however, observed the Complainant attempt to strikeWO#3, withCW#5 describing the Complainant as raising her fist towardWO#3, although she did not see if she actually threw the punch.CW#3 described the Complainant as kicking her feet atWO#3, who was backing away from her and,CW#2, who spoke toCW#1 shortly after the incident resulting inCW#1 making a case note of whatCW#2 told her, indicating that when police were escorting the Complainant down the front steps, “she saw (the Complainant) try to get away from police by attempting to punch the female officer in the face” and that the police then took her to the ground and handcuffed her.TheSOdescribed the Complainant as swinging her right arm towardWO#3’s head, which he described as a roundhouse punch which did not connect, following which he grabbed the Complainant before confirming withWO#3 that the Complainant had in fact taken a swing at her.  This evidence is confirmed byCW#5, who indicated that she heard theSOaskWO#3 if she had been punched, and heardWO#3 respond “no, but almost”.WO#3 indicated that as they entered onto the porch, the Complainant began screaming and motioning towardCW#5 and both officers had to grab the Complainant by the coat in order to prevent her reachingCW#5.WO#3 stated that she then advised the Complainant that she was under arrest for breaching her recognizance, at which point the Complainant pulled her arm away fromWO#3 and threw a punch in her direction, but missed.Based on the evidence, therefore, of the threeCWs, which is consistent with the evidence of the two police officers present, I have no hesitation in rejecting the assertion by the Complainant that she simply lost her balance and reached out to grabWO#3 to prevent herself falling, accepting instead, on the considerable evidence of all the other witnesses, that the Complainant threw a punch atWO#3, but missed.As a result of the actions of the Complainant, theSOthen struck the Complainant on the back of the right leg with the side of his foot, which caused her to fall to the ground, where she was handcuffed.  This was observed by bothCW#5 andCW#3, and was confirmed by theSO, who openly conceded that he stepped back from the Complainant and delivered a boot strike to her right calf, which he described as being made with the side of his right foot from a distance of six to eight inches and using about 45 % of his total strength.  TheSOdescribed this manoeuvre as being one that he had been taught at the Ontario Police College and was to be employed in order to gain compliance from resisting prisoners. The strike had the effect of immediately causing the Complainant to fall to the ground, landing on her right knee.  TheSO, using a controlled movement, then took the Complainant the rest of the way to the ground, whereupon she was handcuffed.According toWO#3, she and theSOwere attempting to control the Complainant, with each holding one of her arms, when the Complainant pulled her arm away and threw a punch in the direction ofWO#3, which missed.WO#3 then regained control of the Complainant’s arm and walked her down the steps to the sidewalk, where the Complainant pulled her arms into her body and grabbedWO#3’s radio microphone, which was on her duty vest.WO#3 believed that it was her action, in trying to pull the Complainant’s arm to the rear, which caused the Complainant to go to her knees.WO#3 indicated that while she was not consciously trying to ‘ground’ the Complainant, she was trying to place her on the ground in a controlled manner, but the Complainant went to her knees, and then down onto the ground on her stomach, where she was handcuffed.There is no dispute that the Complainant immediately screamed about pain to her leg and accused the officers of having broken her leg.WhileWO#3, due to her own focus on the Complainant, apparently did not see theSOdeliver the strike to the back of the Complainant’s right knee, I have no difficulty accepting that the strike is why she went to the ground, based on the evidence of the threeCWs and theSO.The Complainant was then taken initially to the police station, and then to hospital, where an ultrasound revealed that she had sustained a “full-thickness distal patellar tendon rupture”, which ultimately required surgery to repair.Upon a review of several apparently reputable medical websites, it appears that a patellar tendon rupture is a rupture of the tendon that connects the patella (knee cap) to the top portion of the tibia (shin bone).  According towww.drcoyner.com, “Patellar tendon can be ruptured by several reasons such as by fall, direct blow to the knee, or landing on the foot awkwardly from a jump” and towww.hopkinsmedicine.org, “This type of injury is usually the result of a fall or during the landing from a jump” and finally,https://orthoinfo.aaos.orgattributes this type of injury to, “Falls.  Direct impact on the front of the knee from a fall or other blow is a common cause of tears.”As such, while the Complainant attributed her injury to the strike by theSOwith the side of his foot to the back of her knee, it appears that it was not the strike itself which caused her injury, but her fall thereafter whereupon she landed directly on the pavement with her right knee.  From the medical websites mentioned earlier, it appears clear that the impact had to be to the front of the knee, and not the back of the leg.  Furthermore, theSOdescribed his strike as being to the Complainant’s calf, and not the inside of her knee.  Finally, while I note that the Complainant was a large woman, estimated as weighing approximately 245 pounds (111 kilograms), and she fell onto the pavement with her full weight as a result of her knee buckling, I believe the evidence establishes that it is most likely that she was injured when she fell onto her right knee, after throwing a punch atWO#3 and being struck on her right calf by theSO.As such, the question to be determined is whether the grounding of the Complainant, following her assault uponWO#3, was justified in the circumstances or amounted to an excessive use of force.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Codeof Canada, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order for the officers to qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that they were in the execution of a lawful duty, that they were acting on reasonable grounds, and that they used no more force than was necessary.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from the information provided by the shelter staff, that the Complainant was being disruptive and that they wished to have her removed from the premises.  In addition, the information provided to the police officers en route, indicated that the Complainant was in breach of her conditions of release.  Thus, the police were acting in the execution of a lawful duty, when they escorted the Complainant from the shelter pursuant to s. 2 of theTrespass to Property Act, and when they arrested her for breaching the conditions of her release, contrary to s. 145 (3) of theCriminal Code.  As such, as long as the officers used no more force than was necessary and reasonable in the circumstances, their actions are protected from prosecution pursuant to s. 25.In coming to my conclusion, I have considered that although it was theSOwho delivered the strike to the back of the Complainant’s leg,WO#3 was apparently also of the view that the Complainant needed to be taken to the ground in order to maintain control over her.  It is also clear that the Ontario Police College teaches and trains police officers that taking resisting prisoners to the ground is the most effective way to gain compliance and control.  Additionally, I accept that the specific technique employed by theSO, that being a strike to the back of the leg, is also taught in the Police College in order to affect a grounding.Furthermore, it appears on the evidence of both involved police officers that while each was focused on the Complainant, and not on the actions of the other, both officers were simultaneously attempting to take the Complainant to the ground.  While it may well be that with both officers independently trying to take the Complainant to the ground, combined with her substantial weight and the fact that she had been drinking, that the Complainant went to the ground with more momentum than was expected, I cannot attribute this to an excessive use of force on the part of either ofWO#3 or theSO.It is clear on all of the evidence that the Complainant was being resistant and combative and that she had just attempted to punchWO#3, following which she grabbed forWO#3’s radio, as a result of which the police officers had to act, and act quickly, to take control over the Complainant, before the situation got out of hand.  It also appears that in attempting to do so, both officers acted in accordance with their training, and no extraneous or unnecessary strikes were delivered, with all three of theCWs confirming that other than the strike which took the Complainant to the ground, no other strikes, kicks, or force was used against her and, as soon as she was down on the ground, she was handcuffed and then assisted to her feet and to the cruiser.  On this basis, I conclude that the actions ofWO#3 and theSOwere both reasonable and justified in the circumstances, bringing them under the protection of s. 25.In concluding that the actions of either or both ofWO#3 and theSOdo not amount to an unnecessary or excessive use of force, I am mindful of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada as set out inR v Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.On all of the evidence, it is clear that had the Complainant not resisted and attempted to assaultWO#3, no force at all would have been used to apprehend her.  As such, while I find that her serious injury was sustained during her interaction with police, and as a result of the efforts of the police to maintain control over her, the evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that either officer acted outside of the parameters of theCriminal Code.  As such, as I lack the necessary grounds for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	January 23, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=206
,North Bay Police Service,Harris,Ontario,The subsequent post mortem examination report described the cause of the Complainant’s death in the following terms “Sudden death with no anatomical cause associated with acute-on-chronic cocaine and amphetamine abuse/intoxication forcible struggle and possible excited delirium syndrome,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are limited in the force they may use to that which is reasonably necessary in the discharge of anything that they are required or authorized by law to do.  Whether to prevent the continuation of an assault by the Complainant onCW#4, or arrest the Complainant for assaultingCW#4, or both, the officers were clearly engaged in the lawful exercise of their duties when they intervened in an effort to subdue the Complainant and take him into custody.  While the officers may not have immediately appreciated that the Complainant was not of sound mind at the time, they had ample cause to believe he was assaultingCW#4 given what they knew of the situation from the information conveyed to them during their dispatch to the scene and what they witnessed firsthand upon their arrival.[1]Thereafter, given the formidable strength the Complainant displayed in resisting the officers’ efforts to arrest him, I am satisfied the officers restricted their use of force to that which was reasonably necessary in the circumstances.  In the main, this appears to have been a grappling match between the Complainant and the officers; the latter attempting to gain control of the Complainant’s arms and legs (made difficult by the perspiration on the Complainant’s body), the former flailing his limbs against the officers’ efforts.  While aCEWwas used against the Complainant during the struggle, it appears to have had no effect on his recalcitrance.  It was only with the arrival ofWO#6 that the officers managed to handcuff both of the Complainant’s hands, bringing the struggle to an end.  It should be noted that both officers reportedly suffered injuries in the altercation, which, while apparently not serious, is some further indication of the violence with which the Complainant resisted their efforts.  In my view, the officers’ use of force on this record was measured, proportional and within the latitude prescribed by the criminal law.What remains of the officers’ potential criminal liability is the question of the care they provided the Complainant following his arrest.  Here too I am satisfied that the officers’ conduct fell within the limits of the criminal law.  It bears noting that the first request for an ambulance was made by theSOin the middle of his struggle with the Complainant, as soon as it appeared to the officer that the Complainant was not in the right frame of mind and might be in the throes of a drug-induced psychosis.  That request was reiterated with greater urgency at about 5:22 a.m. after the handcuffs were applied to the Complainant, shortly before his breathing became laboured.  The paramedics arrived at the scene at about 5:28 a.m.  In the interim, the officers had placed the Complainant on his side in the recovery position, applied sternum rubs and begunCPR.WO#1 was offered the use of an injectable naloxone kit byCW#4, but declined to administer it to the Complainant as he had not been trained in its injection.  Without commenting on the officer’s decision, it was very likely of no consequence vis-à-vis the types of drugs said to have contributed to his death.  On balance, there is insufficient evidence in my judgment to believe the officers committed any criminal offence based on a want of care toward the Complainant while they waited for the paramedics to arrive.Returning to the findings of the post mortem examination report, indicating that the officers’ struggle with the Complainant was associated in some degree to his death, I accept that there may well be a causal element between the officers’ interventions and the Complainant’s unfortunate passing.  Be that as it may, however, and for the foregoing reasons, I find no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against the subject officer, theSO, or either of the witness officers,WO#1 andWO#6, as there are no reasonable grounds in my view for believing that those interventions were anything but lawful.

,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,She had been to the emergency department of the hospital on February 5-6 and February 20 for suicidal ideations but had been released on both occasions and discharged as not being a danger to herself with follow-up scheduled for the outpatient mental health clinics on February 14 2018 which she did not attend due to lack of money for transportation and on February 27 2018 which she obviously did not attend due to her death,"The following day, February 21, 2018, a 911 call was again received by the 911 communications centre, this time fromCW#2.CW#2 reported that she had observed the Complainant on the roof of her townhouse and that she had been there for the past 30 minutes.  Police and paramedics were again dispatched to the residence.Prior to the arrival of the police,CW#3 went to his balcony and saw the Complainant sitting on the roof of her townhouse looking depressed, and asked her what was wrong, to which she responded that she wanted to jump off the roof.The first police officer to arrive at the residence in response to the 911 call wasWO#2, who approached the Complainant’s townhouse and stood on the ground below where the Complainant was sitting on the edge of the roof and attempted to communicate with her.WO#2 urged the Complainant not to jump and asked the Complainant for her name and why she wanted to jump.WO#2 could not make out any response from the Complainant, butCW#3, who was up on his balcony, heardWO#2 ask the Complainant why she was on the roof and heard the Complainant respond that she didn’t want to be alive anymore.WO#2 was also heard to tell the Complainant that she cared about her and wanted her to come down.WO#2 observed the Complainant to walk around on the roof and sometimes sit on the edge.Shortly after the arrival ofWO#2,WO#1 arrived.  Several civilian witnesses in the area heardWO#2 andWO#1 telling the Complainant not to jump, withWO#2 specifically being heard to tell the Complainant that she cared about her and wanted to help her. While the officers were attempting to speak with the Complainant, she was observed to lean on her backside and move closer to the edge; she was also heard talking to herself and taking deep breaths, which both civilian and police witnesses surmised was an indication that she was about to jump.  While the Complainant was speaking to herself, she was heard to say that life was not worth living and that no one could help her.TheSOarrived at the townhouse at approximately 4:13 p.m. and he too approached and stood below the location where the Complainant was perched on the roof.  TheSOintroduced himself to the Complainant and told her that he was there to help and asked her not to jump, that he would provide her with whatever she needed.  TheSOwas unable to clearly hear what the Complainant was saying, so he asked her to go to her balcony, but she refused.WO#2 then asked if she could come up to the balcony to speak to the Complainant, but again the Complainant refused.  TheSOthen asked the Complainant to move away from the roof’s edge, but she would not.TheSOrequested the attendance of a tactical unit with a ladder and elevating platform, in order to rescue the Complainant from the rooftop.  Fire personnel present asked if they should break into the Complainant’s unit, but theSOadvised them not to do so, as that might spook the Complainant and force her to jump.  TheSOrequested that fire and paramedics remain out of the Complainant’s sightline, for that same reason.Prior to the arrival of any further assistance, the Complainant told the officers to stop looking at her.  BothWO#2 andWO#1 told her that they would not do so, as they believed that the Complainant was asking them to look away in order that she could jump without their observing her do so.  Despite that, the Complainant then leaned forward and jumped, landing on the paved driveway below.  The police officers and paramedics then immediately moved in to perform life saving measures, following which the Complainant was transported to hospital, where she was pronounced dead.According to the communications log, the 911 call fromCW#2 was received at 3:56:30 p.m., and four uniformed police officers were immediately dispatched to the area, with the first beingWO#2, dispatched at 3:59:10 p.m.  The responding sergeant, theSO, was dispatched at 4:01:33 p.m.  While still en route to the residence, theSOrequested the assistance of paramedics and fire, and requested that they stage around the corner from the unit and out of sight.  TheSOfurther requested that dispatch attempt to get a cell phone number and the unit number for the Complainant, and that the tactical unit also attend.At 4:05:04 p.m., the first officer,WO#2, arrived at the location, followed byWO#1 at 4:07:07 p.m. and theSOat 4:13:05 p.m.  Twelve additional police officers were dispatched to the scene and were en route, along with the tactical unit, when at approximately 4:20 p.m., the Complainant jumped from the rooftop.  At 4:22:19 p.m., theSOis recorded as reporting to the dispatcher that the Complainant was Vital Signs Absent (VSA).There is no dispute that the Complainant, of her own accord, spread out her arms and jumped from the roof of her townhouse to the pavement below, which is confirmed by the evidence of the eight civilian and two police witnesses, as well as the evidence from theSO.An examination of the Complainant’s residence bySIUforensic investigators located five handwritten notes authored by the Complainant, which were clearly suicide notes, along with directions with respect to the disposal of her body after her death.  Additionally, a text from the Complainant, which had been timed to be delivered to five recipients after the Complainant’s death, was also provided to theSIUby one of those five recipients.  The text read that if it had been received, the Complainant was dead, as she would have rescinded the text otherwise.  In her suicide notes, the Complainant profusely apologized for what she had done, and clearly indicated that “this was my best option.  Life has been so hard and I am making my peace with it. This was no one’s fault but my own,” and, “I always knew things would end this way.  I couldn’t visualize my life past 30.”A post-mortem examination carried out on the body of the Complainant determined that the cause of death was as a result of blunt force trauma to the head and torso, resulting in an aortic rupture, following a descent from a height.It is clear, on a review of all of the evidence, that the Complainant had decided to take her own life and had planned and taken all the steps needed to carry out her intention, from writing out a number of suicide notes, including her wishes as to how her body should be dealt with after her death, to sending out a timed text message to family and friends, and to placing a stool and a chair on the balcony of her townhouse, in order that she could easily climb over and access the roof. On all of the evidence, it is clear that the Complainant was struggling with some issues which she found were insurmountable and she felt that her only recourse was to end her life. While it is unclear what exactly pushed the Complainant to the brink and caused her to resort to the drastic decision to end her own life, it is clear that she had made that decision on her own, and had been contemplating it for some time.  The police officers who attended and tried to save the Complainant’s life, despite her wishes to the contrary, did all they could to try to save that life in the very short time available to them, before the Complainant took that last fatal leap.While theSO, as the senior officer on scene, was designated as the subject officer, it is clear that all of the officers present acted together in order to attempt to save the life of the Complainant.On these facts, the only charge even remotely relevant for consideration would be that of criminal negligence causing death, contrary to sections 219 and 220 of theCriminal Code.  In order to find reasonable grounds to believe that theSO, or either ofWO#2 orWO#1, committed the offence of criminal negligence causing death, one must first have reasonable grounds to believe that they had a duty toward the Complainant which they omitted to carry out, and that omission, pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. J.F.(2008), 3 S.C.R. 215, represented ‘a marked and substantial departurefrom the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in circumstances’ where they ‘either recognized and ran an obvious and serious risk to the life’ of the Complainant or, ‘alternatively, gave no thought to that risk’.It is clear on all of the evidence that all of the police officers present fully appreciated the risk to the life of the Complainant, should she be allowed to carry out her intention of jumping from the rooftop.  Each of the three officers made every effort, as was witnessed by numerous civilian witnesses interviewed, to attempt to build a rapport with the Complainant and to convince her to abandon her intentions.  Additionally, even prior to arriving on scene, theSOacted quickly and efficiently to ensure that all necessary services were notified and present on scene to either rescue the Complainant, or to provide assistance should she succeed in jumping.  Rather than a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances, each of these officers acted more than reasonably and prudently to save the Complainant’s life, despite the tragic outcome.  It is clear from the coordinated response of thePRP, that they were taking the threat to the Complainant’s life extremely seriously and that they responded both quickly and efficiently to prevent this tragic death.On all of the evidence, it is clear that the Complainant took her own life without any intervention by police.  It is further clear that the Complainant, while constantly perched on the edge of the rooftop of her townhouse, left police with no options to which they could resort to attempt to safely bring her down, other than to try and convince her to abandon her plan.  TheSOfollowed all procedures as set out in the policy guidelines, and reached out to all resources at his disposal to try and assist the Complainant, and cannot be held responsible for the Complainant’s actions in fulfilling her intention to end her own life.  On all of the evidence, it is clear that all three officers present attempted to engage the Complainant with both calm and compassion, and that they never abandoned their attempts to save her life, even after she had jumped from the rooftop which ultimately led to her death, when they immediately moved in to perform life-saving procedures.On these facts, I find that the evidence fails to satisfy me either that the conduct of any responding police officer represented ‘a marked and substantial departure’ from that of a reasonably prudent person in these circumstances, or that there is any causal connection between the actions of the officers present and the tragic death of the Complainant.  As such, there are no grounds here, reasonable or otherwise, for the consideration of criminal charges and even less so for the laying of same.Date:	November 2, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=114

,Guelph Police Service,Guelph,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant underwent a Computed Tomography CT scan and was diagnosed with an “undisplaced fracture involving the right transverse process of the T-1” thoracic vertebrae of the spinal column,"TheSOobserved a Dodge Journey motor vehicle enter the parking lot and park, and he queried the licence plate on his in-car computer.  As he waited for a response to his query, the Dodge left the parking lot and drove to a Petro Canada gas station and store, and theSOfollowed while keeping a discreet distance.  His query revealed that the vehicle was registered to a woman, while he had observed that the driver on this date was a male.  Moreover, the query further indicated that a 29 year old male had previously been stopped while driving that same motor vehicle and that that male’s driver’s licence had been found to be under suspension.  As a result of this information, theSOdecided to stop and investigate the motor vehicle, as he was fully entitled to do pursuant to s. 216 of theHighway Traffic Act(HTA).The Complainant, the driver of the Dodge Journey, observed a police cruiser, with its emergency lighting activated, behind his vehicle as he left the gas station.  The Complainant advised that while he initially attempted to pull over to the side of the road for the police cruiser, his passenger, a male who he indicated he had picked up at the side of the road, told him not to stop as he, the male, had a gun.  As a result, the Complainant accelerated and drove off, with the police cruiser, with lights and sirens activated, following behind him.The Complainant estimated his rate of speed at approximately 140 km/h as he tried to evade the police vehicle, and that he drove for about three to four minutes, with the cruiser close behind at all times, when he lost control of his vehicle while making a right-hand turn, entered the median ditch on a divided roadway, and came to a stop.  Both the Complainant and his unidentified male passenger then immediately exited the vehicle and began to run away.The Complainant said that as he ran across the road, theSOpursued him on foot, and yelled at him to stop or he would be shot, whereupon the Complainant put his hands in the air and he was arrested and handcuffed.  The Complainant told the officer that he did not feel well and was in pain, and an ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital.  The Complainant indicated that aCTscan at the hospital revealed that he had sustained a fractured rib, a fractured spine, and a neck injury.The Complainant’s medical records, which were obtained with his consent, indicate that the lumbar spine radiographs revealed, “Mild anterior height loss at T12.  A compression fracture cannot be ruled out.” However, theCTscan of the spine only confirmed, “an undisplaced fracture involving the right transverse process of T1.  No cervical spine fractures are seen”, from which I infer that despite a T12 compression fracture being initially suspected, it was disproven after theCTscan.  While the medical records contradict the Complainant’s indication of his injuries in his statement to theSIU, I have not considered this inconsistency as going to the Complainant’s credibility, but rather attribute it to possible confusion on his part revolving around the medical terminology.During the course of this investigation, there were only two witnesses to the events that preceded the single vehicle collision involving the Complainant, that being the Complainant himself, and the subject officer, theSO.  While three other police witnesses were interviewed, none observed the actual event leading up to the collision, although each heard from theSOas to what had occurred, and their recounting of events as to what theSOtold them was consistent with the evidence provided by theSOin his interview withSIUinvestigators.  Additionally, theSIUhad access to the Global Positioning System [GPS] data from theSO’s police vehicle, the police communications recording, and closed circuit television (CCTV) from two commercial premises along the route taken by the Complainant and theSO.The dispatch records confirm that at 9:12:49 p.m. on February 19, 2018, theSOqueried the licence plate of the Dodge Journey being operated by the Complainant, and that at 9:12:52 p.m., theSOviewed the response on his in-car computer.  At 9:16:38 p.m., dispatch was advised that the Dodge Journey had gone into the median.TheCCTVfrom the Petro Canada station confirms that the Dodge Journey entered the parking lot at 00:05 seconds into the video (there being no accurate clock on the video), with the police cruiser entering at 00:06.  The Dodge parks in front of the store and the driver exits and enters the store where he appears to try and make a purchase, but leaves without buying anything; he is in the store for approximately 18 seconds and then exits and re-enters his vehicle, driving out of the parking lot 20 seconds after entering.  The police cruiser, which had reversed into a parking space on the opposite side of the lot, is seen to quickly exit behind the Dodge.  Although his lights are not yet activated as he is seen exiting, the reflection from the emergency lighting system can be seen as soon as the police vehicle is out of sight, at 00:30 into the video.According to the timer on theCCTVfootage from the Volkswagen dealership, a very fast moving vehicle, which appears to be travelling at twice the speed of the other vehicles on the roadway, is seen to enter the screen at 9:13:53 p.m., with the police cruiser, with lighting activated, entering the screen three seconds later, at 9:13:56 p.m.  (It is impossible to tell if the clock on the video is accurate.)The communications recording reveals theSOcalling in (at 00:00 according to the timer) and indicating the following:00:00Just a heads up – tried to make a traffic stop with a male00:03exiting the Petro Canada on Woodlawn00:08he’s since notched off – taken off southbound on Hanlon00:11Ooh, he’s gone into the grass median00:14He’s fleeing on foot towards the Value Inn00:20Oh, he’s dropped something now.It is noteworthy that there are no gaps while theSOis speaking, and from the time that he reports that he has just tried to perform a traffic stop until the time that he reports the car going into the median, no more than 11 seconds pass.According to theSO, he parked and observed the Dodge while the driver got out and entered the Petro Canada gas station, and he received the response to his computer query while the Dodge simultaneously left the gas station heading eastbound on Woodlawn Road West, which would put the time, according to the computer terminal data from his cruiser, at 9:12:52 p.m.  TheCCTVfootage from the Petro Canada station confirms theSO’s evidence that he then engaged his emergency lighting system. TheSOestimated that he was approximately one car length behind the Dodge when he engaged his emergency lighting system, following which the Dodge moved from the fast lane, into the slow lane of traffic, and then sped away. At that time, theSOengaged his siren, but as the Dodge increased its speed, he turned off both his lights and siren and did not pursue the vehicle.TheSOdescribed observing the Dodge weaving in and out of traffic prior to theSOlosing sight of the vehicle altogether.  Despite the Suspect Apprehension Pursuit policy, theSOdid not pull over and record his mileage, since, in his view, he had never been involved in a pursuit with the Dodge.  Instead, with both his lights and siren turned off, theSOcontinued on in the same direction as he had last seen the Dodge travelling, when, at approximately 9:16 p.m., he came across the vehicle in the median between the north and southbound lanes of traffic on Hanlon Parkway, just south of Woodlawn Road West, where it was stuck and the Complainant was attempting to move the vehicle.TheSOthen turned his emergency lighting system back on for safety, following which a civilian witness told him that two occupants had fled from the car, and pointed him westbound towards a fence, where he observed the Complainant running.  He observed the Complainant to slip and fall in the snow, whereupon theSOran up to him, and arrested and handcuffed him.  The Complainant was compliant with the police commands at that point.  The Complainant advised theSOthat he had picked up his passenger at the motel but could not identify him; no mention was made of a gun.  A significant amount of marijuana and cocaine was found inside the motor vehicle.Both Witness Officer (WO) #2 andWO#1 spoke to theSOafter the collision and he relayed to them what had occurred.  What theSOtold them then was identical to the account which he provided during his interview with theSIU.WO#1 additionally recalled that theSOhad told him that as soon as he turned off his emergency equipment and followed in the direction where he had last seen the Dodge travelling, the car lost control almost immediately while turning onto Hanlon Parkway, and went into the ditch.The Collision Reconstruction report prepared by theSIUReconstructionist confirms the evidence of theSO, in that the [GPS] data confirms that theSO’s vehicle travelled in the easterly direction for 40 seconds with an average speed of 62.3 km/h in a 60 km/h zone, over a distance of approximately 692 metres, and only first exceeded the speed limit when it reached approximately 120 metres east of the Petro Canada station, and 290 metres prior to the Volkswagen dealership, which appears to accord with theCCTVfootage.  The time/distance calculations indicate that once east of the Volkswagen dealership, the police cruiser was travelling at an average speed of 91 km/h for no more than five seconds, and that he was 3.8 seconds behind the Dodge Journey.  The collision site was located only 300 metres east of the Volkswagen dealership.  There is no evidence that the police cruiser and the Dodge Journey ever made any physical contact, nor is that alleged by the Complainant.Based on this evidence then, I find that theSOattempted a traffic stop pursuant to s. 216 of theHTA, which he was legally entitled to do in order to check the documents of the driver of the Dodge Journey, and to ensure he was legally entitled to operate a motor vehicle.  Almost immediately upon engaging his emergency lighting system in order to stop the Dodge, however, the driver, the Complainant, accelerated sharply and sped away; this is not disputed by the Complainant.  The evidence of the Complainant wherein he asserts that he had a man with a gun in the car, and where he had picked that man up prior to his encounter with the police cruiser, while not relevant to the matter under investigation here, does give me some pause with respect to the Complainant’s credibility, in that he failed to mention this gun to police at the time of his arrest, and there appears to be some discrepancy as between what he told the police and what he toldSIUinvestigators as to where he had picked up the man.On the whole, however, there appears to be little dispute as to the facts, with the exception that theSOindicated that he had slowed and deactivated his lights and sirens seconds prior to the single vehicle collision in which the Dodge Journey was involved, whereas the Complainant believed that the police vehicle was behind him throughout.   I find that while there was only a matter of seconds between the time that theSOgave up his attempt at a vehicle stop, and the collision, as revealed by the communications recording, it may well be that in the heat of the moment, the Complainant believed that the police cruiser was still behind him, when it had in fact slowed and deactivated the emergency equipment.Contrary to the Complainant’s belief, based on the [GPS] data, as well as theCCTVfootage, I find that theSOwas, in fact, driving some distance and at a substantially lesser speed, behind the Complainant’s vehicle, and I have no difficulty accepting that in the darkness, and while the emergency lighting system did throw a long shadow, that the Complainant may well have believed that theSOwas closer than theCCTVfootage revealed to actually be the case.I find further support in this conclusion from the Collision Reconstruction Report which is based on both theGPSdata from the police vehicle, and the time/distance calculations from theCCTVfootage, wherein it was determined that the Complainant was travelling at a speed of 124 km/h, while theSOonly ever reached an average speed of 91 km/h; that the police vehicle, on theCCTVfootage, is already 3.8 seconds behind the Dodge Journey; that no computer report was ever issued by the terminal in theSO’s police vehicle, which would have occurred had his vehicle ever attained a speed of 40 km/h over the speed limit (or 100 km/h); and that both the Complainant and his passenger were able to exit and flee the vehicle prior to the arrival of theSO, with the passenger having sufficient time to make good his escape.The question to be determined then, is whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence, specifically, whether or not his driving rose to the level of being dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249(1) of theCriminal Code, and did thereby cause bodily harm to the Complainant, contrary to s.249(3).Pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada inR v Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, s.249 requires that the driving be “dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place” and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances”.In considering the test for dangerous driving, I note that it is not disputed that although dark out, the weather was clear and the roads were dry.  From my observations of theCCTVfootage of the area in front of the Volkswagen dealership, the artificial lighting in the area appeared adequate and there were no issues with visibility.  While there appeared to be moderate traffic, there is no evidence that theSO’s driving at any time interfered with any other traffic on the road and, while he momentarily accelerated to try and perform a vehicle stop, the evidence appears to confirm that his vehicle only travelled at those speeds for a brief matter of seconds, and that his speeds, while in excess of the speed limit, were not excessively so.On the evidence both of the Complainant, and the time/distance calculations, I find that the Complainant was driving at a far greater speed than was theSOand that he lost control of his vehicle and was involved in a single vehicle collision not because of the actions of theSO, but because of his own voluntary decision to try to outrun police and, in doing so, fleeing at an excessive rate of speed, ultimately causing the collision which resulted in his injuries.Having fully considered the evidence in this matter, as well as the law as set down by our higher courts as to the factors to consider in assessing whether or not I have reasonable grounds to believe that there is sufficient evidence to make out a charge of dangerous driving, I do not find that it is made out on this record.  Taking into account that the only evidence that I have which would support a charge of dangerous driving would be that of a high rate of speed, countered by the evidence that the officer was only driving at that high rate of speed for an extremely short period of time and distance, following which he chose to abandon his efforts to stop the motor vehicle in favour of public safety, I find that the evidence is not sufficient to satisfy me that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the actions of theSOamounted to a ‘marked departure’ of the standard of care of a reasonable person in these circumstances.In conclusion, as the evidence does not satisfy me that theSO’s actions fell outside of the limits of the criminal law, no charges will issue.Date:	December 20, 2018Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=188

,Peterborough Police Service,Peterborough,Ontario,His arm was initially placed in a soft cast followed later by surgery to repair the fracture,"On February 7, 2018, the Complainant arranged the pick-up of his personal property being held by thePPSat police headquarters at 500 Water Street in the City of Peterborough. Unbeknownst to the Complainant, members of thePPSSex Crimes Unit (SCU) were in possession of a warrant for his arrest, issued by a Judge, and were planning to arrest him when he arrived at the station and hold him for a bail hearing.Members of the SCU were out on surveillance on February 7, 2018, with the intention of following the Complainant from the residence where he was temporarily staying, to the station, while other SCU members were in the foyer of the station awaiting his arrival.  On entering the foyer, the Complainant was arrested by Witness Officer (WO) #3 and Subject Officer (SO) #1. He was then brought into an adjacent interview room where he was subjected to a cursory search, handcuffed, cautioned, and advised of his rights to counsel.Immediately upon being arrested, the Complainant began verbally objecting to what was happening.  WhenSO#1 andWO#3 started to escort the Complainant from the main floor of the station to the booking hall, which is in the basement, he began physically resisting by dragging his feet and loudly expressing his displeasure at his arrest.As this was occurring, otherPPSofficers became involved. SCU membersWO#1 andWO#4 assisted in escorting the Complainant to the booking hall by going ahead and opening doors, or remaining close by in the event that their assistance was required.SO#2, a patrol officer, also accompanied the SCU members during the escort.The Complainant was eventually led to the booking hall, where he was paraded in front ofWO#2, the booking officer and station commander.  Throughout the booking process, the Complainant continued his resistant posture by refusing to answer questions posed byWO#2 as part of the booking process and refusing to co-operate when asked to remove his outer clothing and shoes.  Throughout, the Complainant was verbally abusive to the police officers present.The intention of the arresting police officer, as heard on the booking video, was to get the Complainant booked and transported to court in time for an appearance before a Justice of the Peace that same day.  Unfortunately, because of the Complainant’s lack of co-operation, it was apparent that the officers might not be able to get him to court in time for a formal remand or release.The booking video reveals that the police officers repeatedly told the Complainant to calm down and that he was only being treated the same way as everyone else coming into the station, while he made comments such as, “I’m only being violent because this is all bullshit,” and, “You’re trying to book me in.  I’m not going in.”  Various officers in the booking area are heard to repeatedly tell the Complainant that if he would simply cooperate, he could have his bail hearing and possibly be released that same day, withWO#3 on one occasion indicating, “The more you dick around,” the more likely he would not make it to court that day.While the Complainant continually asserted to the officer that there was no way he would be released because he was not from the area, the officers responded by suggesting that whoever was waiting out in the car could possibly sign as surety.  When asked to remove his two outer sweaters, the Complainant again refused to cooperate, whereupon the booking officer,WO#2, told him, “We’re running out of time here.  Take the sweaters off, otherwise you’ll be here all night.  We’re trying to work with you.”  The Complainant, however, continuously maintained that “I’m not going in that shit” and repeatedly referred to his arrest as being “bullshit.”While the Complainant alleges that he was cooperating with the police officers, the video completely contradicts that assertion.  The most that can be said of the Complainant’s behaviour is that he was not actively assaulting any police officer, but he was being openly verbally and physically resistant, and was making every effort to thwart the efforts of the police officers to get him booked into the station so that he could be transported to the courthouse for his bail hearing.As the booking was underway, it was apparent to the police officers involved that the Complainant’s resistive behaviour was escalating, causing them to believe that he may have been contemplating an escape, as a result of whichWO#1 secured the main entry/exit door to the booking hall as a precaution.WhenWO#2 completed the booking process, the Complainant was told that he would be placed in a holding cell while the determination regarding the timing of a court attendance was made.  At that point, the Complainant became even more aggressive, both verbally and physically.SO#2 andSO#1 secured the Complainant’s arms, at which point he made it abundantly clear that he would not be going into the cell under any circumstances.  An effort was made to walk the Complainant from the booking hall into the cell block, but it immediately became necessary for the police officers to drag him along, as he refused to move his feet.WO#3 went ahead and opened the door both to the cell area and to cell #1, and placed the keys into the lock, in order to facilitate the process. When the police officers had the Complainant at the entrance to the cell door, he resisted with all of his strength by dropping his center of gravity to prevent his incarceration.  At that point, the officers actively involved in attempting to lodge the Complainant into the cell wereSO#2 andSO#1, althoughWO#3 was present outside of the cell, as wasWO#2, withWO#1 entering the cell on occasion to assist, andWO#4 standing at the doorway between the booking area and the cell area, keeping watch.The first time that the police officers pulled the Complainant into the cell, he placed his leg out through the door entrance in order to prevent the cell door being closed.  He was then able to wrap his right hand around the door frame, again preventing the cell door from being closed.  This scenario continued untilWO#1 pried the Complainant’s fingers away from the door frame.On the second occasion, whenSO#2 andSO#1 appeared to have successfully deposited the Complainant inside the cell, and were exiting, the Complainant also immediately stood and attempted to leave behind the officers, necessitating the officers again having to re-enter the cell to put the Complainant back inside.  This happened on a third occasion as well, again resulting inSO#2 andSO#1 re-entering the cell and dealing with the Complainant.On the final attempt to place the Complainant into the cell,SO#1 was actively pushing the Complainant into the cell, as he was attempting to leave, andSO#2 was standing behindSO#1.  The video revealsSO#1 pushing the Complainant up against the back wall of the cell, following which the Complainant then appears to finally stop resisting, and sits on the bed cradling his right arm.SO#1 advised that he heard a popping sound, immediately followed by a scream from the Complainant, who instantly grabbed his right arm.  All of the police officers then quickly exited and the cell door was closed and locked.SO#1 was then heard to advise that he may have injured the Complainant’s arm.WO#2 is then seen to stand at the cell door speaking with the Complainant, who confirmed that his arm had in fact been injured during the final attempt to lodge the Complainant into the cell.WO#2 then immediately requested the attendance of the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) to attend to the Complainant.EMSsubsequently attended and assessed the Complainant’s injury, resulting in his transport to the hospital for further assessment.The Complainant’s arm was X-rayed at the hospital and it was discovered that he had sustained a fracture to his right arm.  His arm was initially placed in a soft cast, followed later by surgery to repair the fracture.The Complainant alleges that once inside the cell, the police officers pulled him to the floor and held him down, following which the Complainant was able to get onto the bed and sit down, only to be thrown back down onto the floor yet again.  The Complainant further alleges that when he was thrown to the ground, he landed on his right side, causing his right arm and the right side of his head to strike the floor, with several of the involved police officers landing on top of him, causing severe pain to his right arm.  The Complainant alleges that he then immediately hollered out that he had been injured, following which the police removed his handcuffs.The video, however, does not support the Complainant’s allegations and fully confirms that the Complainant’s handcuffs had already been removed prior to his being placed inside the cell, which had allowed him to grab onto the door to prevent it from being closed.  The video further confirms that the Complainant and the police officers never went to the floor, although it is possible that the Complainant confused the ‘bed’ with the floor, as both were made of cement.  As indicated earlier, however, the video fully confirms the evidence of the police officers, and as it is the best evidence of what occurred, it forms the basis for the finding of facts as outlined above.Despite my rejection of the version of events as outlined by the Complainant as a result of it being unreliable, that does not end the matter, as there is no dispute that the Complainant was seriously injured during his interaction with the police.  An assessment is therefore required to determine whether or not the actions ofSO#1 andSO#2, in using force to lodge the Complainant in the cell, amounted to an excessive use of force in the circumstances thereby vitiating their protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25 (1) of theCriminal Code.Pursuant to s. 25(1), a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order for the subject officers to qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that they were in the execution of a lawful duty, that they were acting on reasonable grounds, and that they used no more force than was necessary in the execution of that lawful duty.On the facts before me, it is clear that thePPShad a valid arrest warrant, authorized by a Judge, to arrest and detain the Complainant.  As such, both the arrest and subsequent attempts to lodge him in a cell pending his transport to the court in order that he be brought before a Justice of the Peace within the time prescribed by theCriminal Code, and to have his bail hearing, if necessary, were in the execution of their lawful duties and were reasonable.  As such, as long as no more force than was necessary and justified in the circumstances was used, the officers would be immune from prosecution.On these facts, where it was clear that the Complainant had to be lodged in a cell following his arrest, and where it was equally clear, both on the Complainant’s verbal comments as heard on the booking video, and his active physical resistance, as seen on the cell video and as indicated by all of the police officers present, the Complainant leftSO#2 andSO#1 no alternatives but to resort to a degree of force slightly greater than that which the Complainant was exhibiting, in order to lodge him in the cell.  Furthermore, it is clear that until the point where the Complainant’s arm struck either the cement wall or the cement bed, and he was injured, he had no intention of giving up on his efforts to resist the officers and leave the cell.  It was only afterSO#1 pushed the Complainant in on the last occasion, whereuponSO#1 heard a popping sound followed by a scream from the Complainant, who then sat on the bed and cradled his arm, that the Complainant finally gave up the fight and acquiesced to remaining in the cell.On these facts, while it is clear that the Complainant was injured as a result of the officers’ active efforts to lodge him into a cell, while attempting to overcome his resistance, it is equally clear that no force at all would have been necessary had the Complainant simply acquiesced and complied with the various and numerous requests by the police to simply cooperate and he could have very well been released from court on that same day.  As such, it appears clear that the Complainant, by his active physical resistance, forcedSO#2 andSO#1 to resort to a slighter greater and opposite reaction to his actions, resulting in the injury sustained.  Had the Complainant not resisted, I have no hesitation in finding that no force at all would have been necessary, and there would have been no injury.In all of the circumstances, the option resorted to bySO#1 andSO#2, in pushing the Complainant back and into the cell after his numerous attempts to exit, was more than reasonable in the circumstances and the only option available to the officers.  In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR v Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.In conclusion, while the Complainant’s injury was unfortunate, in these circumstances, I find that he left the police officers with no other options when he actively and incessantly resisted the actions of the involved police officers to lodge him into the cell.  Furthermore, I have taken note of the fact that no police officer involved with the Complainant, at any time, resorted to any use of force options nor were any strikes, punches, or kicks, ever delivered to the Complainant, with the only force resorted to being to push him back into the cell and quickly close the door.  On this record, I have no hesitation in finding that neither ofSO#1, norSO#2, resorted to any force that can be described as unnecessary, excessive, or unjustified.  Therefore, as I lack the necessary basis for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	December 20, 2018Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=182
,,Durham,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant sustained a comminuted fracture of his left medial malleolus the bone on the inner side of the ankle,"Inside the burgundy motor vehicle at the time were the Complainant andCW#1 and possibly other persons.  Neither the Complainant norCW#1 would admit to driving the motor vehicle, nor would they identify the person they claimed was driving.AsWO#4 attempted a vehicle stop of theSUV, she activated her emergency lighting system, but the vehicle continued at a high rate of speed.WO#4 notified the dispatcher that she was involved in a vehicular pursuit.  TheSUVthen mounted the curb at the intersection of Glovers Road and Ormond Drive, struck a stop sign, and continued to drive off at a high rate of speed.WO#4 continued to follow.  At the intersection of Mary Street North and Taunton Road West, theSUVentered the intersection against the red light, and then continued southbound on Mary Street.WO#4 was unable to keep up with the excessive speed of theSUVand she fell back and was only able to see the vehicle in the distance.  The occupants of theSUVbelieved that they had successfully evaded police at that point, but they continued on at the same high rate of speed, and theSUVfailed to negotiate a left turn at the intersection of Mary Street North and Beatrice Street East, mounted the sidewalk on the corner, and then collided with the fence on the property of a residence.  The Complainant andCW#1 immediately exited the vehicle and fled on foot.WO#4 observed both men run toward the backyard of a residence on Beatrice Street East and she exited her vehicle to follow.WO#4 observed both men climb a chain link fence and jump over, following which the Complainant apparently injured his leg as he landed on the other side.  Both men then continued running towards a ravine located behind the house, with the Complainant running with an obvious limp, whenWO#4 was ordered back to the collision scene by a supervisor.The evidence ofWO#4 in this regard is corroborated by that of the Complainant, who indicated that as they fled the scene, he andCW#1 jumped over two ten foot high fences.  The Complainant recalled that he then began to limp, after he landed on the ground, but he continued to followCW#1 to a nearby ravine where they hid under a tree.CW#1 described the Complainant as falling down an eight foot steep icy hill on their way to the ravine, prior to their hiding in the trees in the ravine, and that the Complainant toldCW#1 that he had broken his leg as a result of that fall.Shortly thereafter, four police officers, theSO, along withWO#1 andWO#2, and a police service dog, tracked the Complainant andCW#1 to their hiding spot where they were arrested.The Complainant indicated that when the police officers arrived at the ravine and located them, the officers yelled at them to remain on the ground with their hands up, and he did so, telling the officers that he was not resisting.  The Complainant alleges thatWO#1 then approached him, placed his hands behind his back, and handcuffed him, following which theSOwalked towards the Complainant’s lower torso and placed his, theSO’s, shin on the back of the Complainant’s left leg.  The Complainant professed that he then felt a pain in his lower leg and believed that he had been injured as a result of theSOexerting force on his leg with his shin.  The Complainant alleges that when he was assisted to his feet, he toldWO#1 that he could not walk as his leg was broken because of theSOexerting force on it with his shin.  The Complainant was certain that he had not injured his leg during the motor vehicle collision and adamantly asserts that his injury was caused by theSO.After his arrest, the Complainant was transported to hospital where his leg was x-rayed and it was discovered that he had sustained a comminuted fracture of his left medial malleolus (the bone on the inner side of the ankle), and his leg was placed into a cast.I note that both paramedics, who attempted to assess the Complainant en route to the hospital, stated that the Complainant refused to disclose how he had been injured.During the course of this investigation, in addition to the Complainant andCW#1, two other civilian and four police witnesses were interviewed, as well as theSO.  Based on the evidence before me, I must reject the allegations of the Complainant as to the source of his injury, as it is contradicted by the other credible and reliable evidence.On the basis thatWO#4 observed the Complainant to have been injured when he landed after jumping over the first fence, which she immediately communicated to the other officers searching for the Complainant, and on the evidence of the Complainant himself that he began to limp after he jumped over two ten foot high fences, as well as the evidence ofCW#1, that he observed the Complainant fall down an eight foot steep icy hill on their way to the ravine, following which, prior to police arrival at their location, the Complainant told him that he had already broken his leg as a result of the fall, I find that I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was injured as he alleged in his interview withSIUinvestigators, accepting instead his version of events as provided to his friend,CW#1, at the time and as corroborated by the evidence ofWO#4.Additionally, based on the evidence ofWO#3, I note that when the officers arrived at the ravine and located the Complainant andCW#1, prior to the police having any direct contact with either man,WO#3 shouted at the Complainant to approach him, and the Complainant responded that he could not, as his leg was broken and he could not move.  This is also consistent with the evidence of bothWO#1 and theSO, who also heard the Complainant indicate that his leg was broken when he was directed to approachWO#1, and prior to any police contact.  Furthermore, I note that all of the police officers present indicated that theSOeffected the arrest ofCW#1, and had no physical contact with the Complainant, who was arrested and handcuffed byWO#1.Finally, I reject the evidence of the Complainant on the basis that his assertion as to how his injury occurred appears to be inconsistent with the injury itself, in that he alleges that as soon as theSOplaced his shin on the Complainant’s leg, he felt pain, and he thereby surmised that this action had fractured his ankle.  While it may well be true that had someone placed their shin on the Complainant’s leg, after his ankle had already been fractured during his earlier fall, that he would have immediately felt pain, I cannot comprehend how simply placing one’s shin on the Complainant’s leg could be of a sufficient force to fracture the bony protuberance on the inner side of the Complainant’s left ankle.In conclusion, based on all of the reliable evidence before me, I am unable to find reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was injured as a result of the intentional infliction of force by any police officer, but rather find that the preponderance of the evidence supports the conclusion that the Complainant sustained his injury as a result of his efforts to flee from police, without any direct interaction or involvement with any police officer.Furthermore, on the credible evidence before me, even were I to accept that the Complainant was injured, or that his previously sustained injury was aggravated by a police officer placing his shin on the Complainant’s leg, despite the Complainant specifically identifying theSOas the officer so responsible, I find that there is no evidence upon which I could identify this act as having been done by theSO, who dealt solely withCW#1.  If an officer did indeed place his shin on the Complainant’s leg, which I do not find on the evidence before me, and which, even if it did occur, is highly unlikely to have caused any injury to the Complainant, I would have to conclude that the officer involved wasWO#1, as all those present indicate that she was the officer who arrested and handcuffed the Complainant.  In the unlikely event that this was the cause of any type of injury to the Complainant, I would also hasten to add that this would in no way possibly amount to an excessive use of force.In coming to this conclusion, I have directed my mind to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances.As indicated earlier, however, on the basis thatCW#1 indicated that no force was used by any police officer in the arrest of the Complainant and himself, and the evidence of all police officers present that both of the Complainant andCW#1 were cooperative and compliant once found and no force was required or used against them, I conclude on the record that the credible evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was injured as alleged by him.As such, having found that the source of the Complainant’s serious injury was not caused by any police officer, but occurred during the Complainant’s efforts to escape when he felland injured himself, I can find no basis for the laying of criminal charges against any police officer and none shall issue.Date:	December 10, 2018Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=160
,Timmins Police Service,Timmins,Ontario,The cause of the Complainant’s death was determined by the forensic pathologist at the post-mortem examination to have been “complications of ENDSTAGE DIABETIC NEPHROPATHY in a woman with ISCHEMIC HEART DISEASE,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=106
,Dryden Police Service,Dryden,Ontario,There was also a sub-acute traverse fracture of the fourth metatarsal bone,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=186
,Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service,Armour,Ontario,On September 1 2018 the SIU received the final Post-Mortem Report which confirmed that the immediate cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds leading to exsanguination blood loss and hemorrhagic shock,"At 10:16 a.m., a radio transmission was received from a police unit indicating that shots had been fired and that theEMSwas required immediately.At 10:45 a.m., the 21-year-old Complainant was pronounced dead at hospital.  A subsequent post-mortem (PM) examination revealed that the Complainant had been shot four times by the Subject Officer (SO) of the TPS and had died as a result of exsanguination (blood loss) from those four gunshot wounds.An investigation was immediately launched bySIUinvestigators.  The objective of the investigation was to determine what happened in the intervening seven minutes between the first call for assistance and the shooting of the Complainant, and if the death of the Complainant was justified under the law, or if criminal charges were warranted against the police officer who caused that death.During the course of the investigation, 17 civilians who witnessed or were involved in various of the interactions with the Complainant were interviewed, as well as eight police witnesses; theSOalso made himself available to be interviewed.  In addition to the eyewitness evidence, the investigation was significantly aided by the availability of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of the events which unfolded from the time that the Complainant entered the ambulance bay at 500 Algonquin Boulevard East, until he was shot on Gillies Lake, as well as the real time narration of events which were recorded on the police transmissions communication recordings as police officers called them in.  Cell phone recordings from two Civilian Witnesses (CWs) also assisted in the investigation.  While it was difficult to clearly make out the actual shooting of the Complainant, which was captured from a distance on the video from the ambulance base and somewhat obscured by the presence of a tree which blocked some of the events, with the enhancement of that video, and the video obtained from the In-Car Camera System (ICCS) of the various police cruisers, an accurate timeline of the unfolding events was extrapolated, a summary of which follows.The Complainant is seen to enter the camera view of the parking lot at the ambulance base and then runs and follows an ambulance into the bay when the garage door opens.  Once inside the bay, the Complainant can be seen standing at the rear of the ambulance.CW#16, a paramedic and the driver of the ambulance, exited the vehicle and saw the Complainant standing inside the bay near the ambulance.  Despite being fully clothed, the Complainant toldCW#16 that he wanted to go to the hospital because he was naked.CW#16 immediately came to the conclusion that there was something wrong with the Complainant.[1]CW#13, another paramedic who was still seated inside the ambulance, overheard the Complainant tellCW#16 that he had ingested cocaine, and she contacted theEMSdispatcher via her portable radio and requested police assistance.The Complainant was observed to be balling his fists and he began saying, “I just want to be shot in the fucking head.”CW#13 then immediately went to the dispatch phone inside the bay and made a second call requesting immediate police assistance;CW#13 was told that the police were already on the way.The communications recording confirms this evidence in that a follow up call is received from theEMSdispatcher to the TPS dispatcher at 10:11:26 a.m., in which she advises, “So the male that walked in – he’s hallucinating and asking for someone to shoot him in the head.”CW#14, a paramedic, observed the Complainant holding two knives, which were sticking out of his gloves, and saw him raise his hands to his throat and say, “Maybe I will just use these on myself!”CW#14 immediately advised the other paramedics that the Complainant was armed with two knives.  BothCW#14 andCW#16 then calmly told the Complainant not to do that, and the Complainant then tucked the knives back into his gloves and began to walk toward the office area, with the paramedics telling him to stop.CW#13 then opened one of the garage doors and told the Complainant to leave, and he complied.  AsCW#13 was closing the door, Witness Officer (WO) #1 was observed to enter the parking lot in his marked police vehicle.The paramedics then re-opened the garage door and watched the interaction betweenWO#1 and the Complainant.  According to their evidence,WO#1 was motioning the Complainant to stay where he was, when the Complainant suddenly ran towardWO#1.CW#14, who was watching the interaction, indicated that she feared that the Complainant was going to attackWO#1 with the knives, whileCW#13 described the action as the Complainant lunging forward and towardsWO#1 with the knives in his hands. In response to the Complainant’s movement,WO#1 quickly ran behind his cruiser, putting the cruiser between himself and the Complainant, and drew his Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW), pointing it at the Complainant.  The Complainant then turned and ran toward the corner of the parking lot, where he dropped his backpack and one of his knives,[2]and then went over the snowbank.WO#1 followed on foot, but was some distance behind.This evidence is consistent as between the five paramedics interviewed,WO#1, the communications recordings, and theCCTVfootage from the ambulance base.The communications recording hasWO#1 reporting in, over his police radio, at 10:13:30 a.m.WO#1 is heard to be out of breath and appears to be running, consistent with his calling in over his portable radio as he is pursuing the Complainant on foot.  The recording revealsWO#1 reporting, “He’s got two knives.  Toward Gillies Lake,” he then provides a description of the Complainant, before continuing with, “Just dumped the backpack.  He’s got two … they appear to be small knives, in each hand.  He’s headed toward Gillies Lake … go to Gillies Lake.”This evidence is confirmed by the backpack and one of the two knives which were located at the base of the snow pile at the corner of the ambulance base parking lot, en route to the conservation area and Gillies Lake.TheSO, who had also initially been responding to the call for assistance at the ambulance base, is then heard to respond, “I’m pulling up.  I see him.”While the Complainant andWO#1 then run out of the view of the paramedics, observations are picked up by eleven independentCWs.CW#2 heard sirens outside of her residence, at which point she looked out and saw a police vehicle driving into the parking lot on the south side of Gillies Lake, with emergency lights and sirens activated, and the Complainant running northbound toward the lake.  She then observed theSOexit his police vehicle and begin to chase the Complainant on foot.CW#2 also observedWO#1 running from the south parking lot in the same direction as the Complainant, but some distance away.CW#2 advised that the Complainant stopped when he arrived at the snowmobile trail that crossed the lake and turned to face theSO.  TheSOthen suddenly began to back away from the Complainant, who lunged at him.CW#2 then heard a volley of three gunshots and saw the Complainant drop to the ground.CW#2 was very clear thatWO#1 only arrived after the gunshots had been fired.CW#2 then observed the Complainant in a seated position in the snow, with the two police officers keeping their distance from him, standing approximately five to ten feet away.  The Complainant then fell backwards into the snow, following which the officers moved in, turned him over, picked him up and carried him toward a waiting ambulance.CW#8 observed the Complainant standing about 15 feet from theSOon the lake, while theSOhad his arms outstretched toward the Complainant, whichCW#8 took as theSOgesturing or warning the Complainant to not approach him or to stop moving.CW#8 observed the Complainant to then raise his hands above his shoulders and move one foot toward theSO, which she described as resembling a stumble or a misstep, with the Complainant’s hands remaining raised as he continued to move toward theSO.CW#8 then looked away, following which she heard a volley of three gunshots.  Shortly thereafter, a second police officer arrived and went out onto the lake.Similarly,CW#3’s attention was drawn by the sound of sirens and he looked out and observed a marked TPS vehicle park in the Gillies Lake Conservation parking lot.CW#3 also observed the Complainant running northbound through the knee deep snow on Gillies Lake.CW#3 then observed theSOchase the Complainant, on foot, northbound onto the lake, with theSOabout 10 to 15 yards (9.1 to 13.7 metres) behind the Complainant; no other police officers were in the area at that time.CW#3 heard theSOtell the Complainant to put his hands up, turn around, and come back towards him, and then saw the Complainant stop, turn with his hands up, but then suddenly lower his hands down and start “full running at the officer.”CW#3 saw theSOthen draw hisCEWand he heard the sound of theCEWbeing deployed.  He was familiar with the sound of aCEWfrom past experience. The Complainant, however, did not go down, from whichCW#3 inferred that theCEWhad not worked properly.CW#3 estimated that at the time that theCEWwas deployed, theSOand the Complainant were about ten feet apart.CW#3 then observed the Complainant continue to run at theSO, who then quickly drew his firearm.  Less than three seconds after the deployment of theCEW,CW#3 heard a volley of three gunshots.CW#3 estimated that at the time that he heard the firearm being discharged, the Complainant had narrowed the distance between himself and the officer to five feet.CW#3 then saw the Complainant go down to the ground, at which point two additional police officers arrived.CW#3 then activated his cell phone video, and although he did not capture the actual shooting, he repeated what he had just seen, only seconds before.  That version of events was provided toSIUinvestigators and is totally consistent with the evidence thatCW#3 provided in his statement.  I find this evidence, recorded within seconds of the events occurring, to be extremely compelling as there was no opportunity for memories to fade or facts to become confused.  In his narrative, he is heard to say, “Shots were fired. They Tasered him first, he didn’t move, he didn’t stop, so…. I heard three shots.  I can’t see that much from here.  I’m on the other side of Gillies.   Suspect started running across, he stopped, then he started to run at the officer.”CW#1 was parked in the Gillies Lake Conservation Area parking lot facing Gillies Lake when he observed the Complainant run past his vehicle, on the passenger side, followed by theSOabout ten seconds later, on the driver’s side.CW#1 described both men as running out onto the frozen lake, in snow that he estimated to be between one foot and one and one half feet deep, which caused the Complainant difficulty as he tried to run.CW#1 observed the Complainant to stop and turn to face theSOwhen he was about 25 feet out on the lake, with theSOthen pulling out hisCEWand warning the Complainant to stop, or he would use hisCEW.CW#1 estimated the distance between the Complainant and the police officer as approximately 15 to 20 feet when the Complainant stopped and turned toward the officer.CW#1 then heard a “zapping” sound, which he associated with the deployment of theCEW, but he observed that theCEWhad no effect on the Complainant, who was approximately ten feet from theSOwhen theCEWwas deployed.  Immediately following the deployment of theCEW,CW#1 saw the Complainant run toward theSO, causingCW#1 concern that theSOwas in trouble and needed help, as a result of whichCW#1 exited his vehicle to assist theSO.  While exiting his vehicle, however,CW#1 heard three quick gunshots.  Within seconds after the gunshots,CW#1 sawWO#1 arrive;WO#1 toldCW#1 to get back into his car.CW#1 then heardWO#1 speak into his portable radio, and indicate, “Shots fired!  Shots fired!”The communications recording confirms this evidence in that it reveals a police officer calling in at 10:16:47 a.m. and reporting, “Shots have been fired!  Shots have been fired! Is there an ambulance on the way to Gillies Lake?”  Other officers then arrived and carried the Complainant to an ambulance, upon its arrival.CW#7 heard three or four gunshots from his living room and looked out to see the Complainant lying in the snow and two police officers running toward him from the Gillies Lake Conversation Area, followed by a third police officer shortly thereafter.CW#7 then observed the police officers to pick up and carry the Complainant toward an ambulance that had just arrived, with the officers falling in the snow at one point.  This is also seen on theCCTVvideo, where one can see that the depth of the snow is hampering the movement of the officers, and that at one point they fall while carrying the Complainant.One civilian witness,CW#4, provided evidence which was completely contradicted both by the other independentCWs and theCCTVfootage.CW#4 indicated that he heard a gunshot from his home and when he looked out, he saw the Complainant kneeling in the snow facing two police officers.CW#4 described each police officer as being about ten feet from the Complainant, with the officer on the right having his knees bent and his arms extended, which he took as the officer pointing a firearm at the Complainant.CW#4 advised that he then observed the officer fire three shots, one after the other, at the Complainant while he was on his knees.CW#4 then observed these two police officers to approach the Complainant, while two more officers then also ran onto the ice and toward the Complainant.Based on the overwhelming evidence of the other independentCWs, as confirmed by theCCTVandICCSvideo footage, it is clear that three or four gunshots were heard by the witnesses in one grouping and that no firearm was discharged thereafter; that the Complainant only went to the ground after these three or four gunshots and, while theSOcontinued to point his firearm at the Complainant after he had fired his weapon, no further shots were fired.  All of the other witnesses, as well as the video footage, confirm that theSOwas alone on the lake with the Complainant when the Complainant ran at him and theSOfired his weapon.  As such, I am unable to accept the evidence ofCW#4 as being accurate and I reject his evidence in favour of that of the otherCWs, the video recordings, and the physical evidence.The various video recordings confirm the evidence of ten of the 11CWs, as well as the police witnesses, with the exception ofCW#4, whose version of events is definitively negated by the video evidence.In his initial interaction withWO#1 at the ambulance base parking lot, the Complainant is seen on the video to “lunge” atWO#1, who immediately backs up behind his police vehicle and pulls hisCEW, which he does not have the opportunity to deploy as the Complainant runs off withWO#1 following, while alerting dispatch and his fellow officers that the Complainant was armed with two knives.TheICCSvideo from theSO’s cruiser reveals the Complainant running pastCW#1’s vehicle, which was parked in the Gillies Lake Conservation Area parking lot, with theSOexiting his police vehicle and giving chase on foot.  TheICCSaudio then picks up theSOsaying to the Complainant, in a fairly calm voice, “Drop the knives.  Drop the knives, okay brother?”  This is also recorded on the communications recording, which has it noted as having occurring at 10:14:36 a.m.Both theICCSvideo and theCCTVvideo from the ambulance base confirm that theSOruns out onto the lake after the Complainant and that, at one point, the Complainant turns and faces theSO, who then begins to back away but is hampered because he keeps breaking through the deep snow and losing his balance.  Initially, theSOis seen with an object in his hand, presumably theCEWbased on the evidence of the independent witnesses, while the Complainant nears.  The movements of the Complainant can be described as quick and with momentum, while theSOimmediately tries to back away and increase the distance between them, but is again hampered by the deep snow.  TheSOis then seen to reach for his sidearm, presumably having thrown hisCEWaway after the ineffective deployment as described by the witnesses, while the Complainant continues to quickly close the space between them.  Within 28 seconds of theSOtelling the Complainant to drop the knives, an officer is heard to report that theEMSis needed, which was recorded as occurring at 10:15:04 a.m.  Unfortunately, the discharge of the firearm is not clearly heard on the recordings and therefore it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when the shots were fired, other than to conclude that they occurred within those 28 seconds.TheSOstated that upon hearing the radio transmission fromWO#1, he drove across Algonquin Boulevard East towards Gillies Lake and into the parking lot of the Gillies Lake Conservation Area, where he immediately saw the Complainant running northbound towards the lake.  He saw the Complainant run pastCW#1’s motor vehicle and out onto the snow covered lake, following which theSOexited his police vehicle and followed.  TheSOdescribed the snow as being knee deep and difficult to run through.TheSOindicated that his pursuit of the Complainant was based on his belief that he had reasonable grounds to arrest the Complainant for weapons related offences, due to the information fromWO#1 that the Complainant was in possession of two knives and was therefore a risk to the safety of the public.As theSOpursued the Complainant, he considered his use of force options and decided, based on his training, that the most effective and least harmful way in which to apprehend the Complainant was to resort to hisCEW, which he then accessed from his duty belt.  TheSOestimated that he was approximately 25 metres out on the frozen lake when the Complainant stopped and turned to face him, in what he described as a ‘bladed’ stance, with a knife in his left hand and his right hand obscured behind his back. TheSOthen deployed hisCEWat the Complainant, but it was ineffective, likely due to the amount of clothing worn by the Complainant, which prevented the prongs of theCEWmaking contact with the Complainant’s skin.Following deployment of theCEW, the Complainant continued to advance toward theSOwith the knife in his hand.  TheSO, while trying to back away and increase the distance between himself and the Complainant, was unable to do so because the snow was too deep, making it difficult to manoeuvre.  TheSOdescribed the Complainant as having closed the distance between them to about seven metres, and he was gaining momentum forward, faster than theSOcould back away.  TheSOdescribed himself as having nowhere to go and that he was trapped.TheSOadvised that his thinking at the time was that the Complainant was prepared to stab and kill theSO, so he immediately dropped hisCEWand drew his sidearm, firing a volley of three to four shots.  TheSOadvised that it was his intention to fire low at the Complainant’s body, as he did not intend to kill him.  The Complainant then fell into the snow, but remained in a partially seated position with the knife still held in his hand; as a result, theSOindicated that he could not determine whether or not the Complainant had actually been struck by any of the bullets.  TheSOthen continued to direct the Complainant to drop the knife, while he maintained gunpoint coverage of the Complainant.  While it was clear that the Complainant was still conscious, he did not respond, nor did he drop the knife.When other officers arrived,WO#2 cautiously moved toward the Complainant and removed the knife from his hand, while theSOcontinued to cover him with his firearm.WO#2 described the Complainant as having a firm grip on the knife and that it required some effort for him to remove the knife.  He then placed the knife inside his own pocket, in order that it not be lost in the deep snow.Two wire leads from theSO’sCEWwere located leading from theCEWto the coat of the Complainant.  TheCEWitself was located lying in the snow with the wires still attached, and it was retrieved and secured.  The download data from theSO’sCEWconfirmed that it was deployed on one occasion, at 10:14:57 a.m., which, according to the times on the communications recording, would have had him discharging his firearm within approximately seven seconds of the failedCEWdeployment.When the Complainant was later examined, he was found to have black electrical tape wrapped around his waist, green painter’s tape wrapped around his chest with meat packaging material under the tape, and black electrical tape wrapped around his right leg.  TheSIUinvestigation could find no explanation for why the Complainant applied this unusual ‘apparel’ to his person.[3]After the Complainant had been carried to the ambulance and taken to hospital, theSOprovided a recount of what had occurred leading up to the shooting of the Complainant to two other officers present.  That account was consistent with that provided in his statement toSIUinvestigators, and fully accorded with the evidence of all of theCWs, with the exception of the one witness whose evidence I have discounted, as well as the other police witnesses, the various video and audio recordings, observations made at the scene, and the physical evidence.  As such, I am satisfied that the version of events provided by theSOis an accurate recounting of what occurred.  In assessing the evidence, however, I have relied primarily on the eyewitness evidence of 10 of the 11CWs, with specific emphasis on that ofCW#1, who was in the best position to see what occurred, andCW#3,CW#8, andCW#2, who all observed the interaction between theSOand the Complainant in the seconds immediately prior to theSOdischarging his firearm, as well as the various video recordings.On the basis of this extremely convincing evidence, then, I accept that theSOpursued the Complainant onto the frozen surface of Gillies Lake, which was covered in snow of about knee height making manoeuvring difficult; that theSOhad reasonable grounds to apprehend the Complainant on a charge of possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88 of theCriminal Code; that once out on the ice, the Complainant turned to face theSOand refused to drop his weapon; that as the Complainant advanced on theSO, theSOdeployed hisCEW, which was ineffective in that it did not stop the Complainant advancing; that the Complainant had his arm raised, with a knife in hand, and was quickly moving towards theSO, who, due to the depth of the snow, was unable to back away from the Complainant as quickly as the Complainant was advancing on him; and that as the Complainant closed the distance between himself and theSO, and refused to either stop or to drop his weapon, theSOdischarged his firearm on four occasions, striking the Complainant and causing his death.Before proceeding to my decision, I wish to address the Post-Mortem Report in which the forensic pathologist noted that three of the bullets from theSO’s firearm entered from the front of the Complainant’s body, travelling toward the back, while a fourth bullet entered from the back and exited through his chest.  While at first blush this may raise some suspicions as to the position of the Complainant in relation to theSOwhen theSOdischarged his firearm, it is without dispute, based on both the video evidence and that of the independentCWs, that the Complainant was both facing, and advancing toward, theSOwhen theSOdischarged his firearm.  While this may seem inconsistent with the forensic evidence, I can only surmise that while theSOwas discharging his firearm, after the first, or more, of the bullets struck the Complainant, his body either twisted or turned, or he leaned forward causing the last bullet to enter through his back.  I find, on all of the evidence, that theSOdid not initially discharge his firearm when any part of the Complainant’s back was turned towards him. While I am not an expert in this area, I note that there is some literature which supports the conclusion that during the time that it takes to discharge a firearm, a body can change direction resulting in a bullet entering from the back.  I find further support in this conclusion from the fact that the bullet which entered from the back did so on a downward angle, which would appear consistent with the Complainant bending forward after being initially struck, causing the last of the projectiles to enter through his left upper back and exiting through the left chest wall.[4]The Law and AnalysisThe question that remains to be answered, then, on the facts as I have found them, is whether or not theSOwas justified in using lethal force against the Complainant, or whether the discharging of his firearm at the Complainant was an excessive use of force in these circumstances and provides reasonable grounds for the laying of criminal charges against theSOfor causing the death of the Complainant.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Codeof Canada, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Further, pursuant to subsection 3:(3)  … a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.As such, in order for theSOto qualify for protection from prosecution under section 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.  Furthermore, pursuant to subsection 3, since death was caused, it must also be established that theSOdischarged his firearm believing on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in order to preserve himself, or others, from death or grievous bodily harm.Turning first to the lawfulness of the attempted apprehension of the Complainant, it is clear from the radio transmissions ofWO#1, that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was in possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace, contrary to s. 88 of theCriminal Code.  As such, I am satisfied that the pursuit and apprehension of the Complainant was legally justified in the circumstances.With respect to the other requirements pursuant to s.25(1) and (3), I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR v Nasogaluak(2010) 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. (p. 218)The court describes the test required under s.25 as follows:Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances. That is not the end of the matter. Section 25(3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force, i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily harm. The officer's belief must be objectively reasonable. This means that the use of force under s. 25(3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis (Chartier v. Greaves, (2001) O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).The decision of Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice inChartier v Greaves, (2001) O.J. No. 634, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada above, sets out other relevant provisions of theCriminal Codeto be considered, as follows:27. 	Use of force to prevent commission of offence - Everyone is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary(a)	to prevent the commission of an offence(i) for which, if it were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and(ii) that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone, or(b)	to prevent anything being done that, on reasonable grounds, he believes would, if it were done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).This Section, therefore, authorizes the use of force to prevent the commission of certain offenses. “Everyone"" would include a police officer. The force must not be more than that which is reasonably necessary. Therefore, an objective test is called for. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Scopelliti (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 held that the use of deadly force can be justified only in either cases of self-defence or in preventing the commission of a crime likely to cause immediate and serious injury.34(1) 	Self-defence against unprovoked assault - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him to defend himself.(2)	Extent of justification - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted and whocauses death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified if(a)	he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and(b)	he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.In order to rely on the defence under subsection (2) of Section 34, a police officer would have to demonstrate that he/she was unlawfully assaulted and caused death or grievous bodily harm to the assaulter in repelling the assault. The police officer must demonstrate that he or she reasonably apprehended that death or grievous bodily harm would result to him or her and that he or she, again on reasonable grounds, believed that he/she could not otherwise preserve himself/herself from death or grievous bodily harm. Again, the use of the term reasonable requires the application of an objective test.The court also sets out a number of other legal principles gleaned from the legal precedents cited, including the following:(h) 	Whichever section of theCriminal Codeis used to assess the actions of the police, the Court must consider the level of force that was necessary in light of the circumstances surrounding the event.(i) 	""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". The same applies to the use of force in making an arrest or preventing an escape. Like the driver of a vehicle facing a sudden emergency, the policeman ""cannot be held to a standard of conduct which one sitting in the calmness of a court room later might determine was the best course."" (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).(j) 	Police officers perform an essential function in sometimes difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. The police must not be unduly hampered in the performance of that duty. They must frequently act hurriedly and react to sudden emergencies. Their actions must therefore be considered in the light of the circumstances.(k) 	""It is both unreasonable and unrealistic to impose an obligation on the police to employ only the least amount of force which might successfully achieve their objective. To do so would result in unnecessary danger to themselves and others. They are justified and exempt from liability in these situations if they use no more force than is necessary, having regard to their reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers in which they find themselves"" (Levesque v. Zanibbi et al.).On the basis of the foregoing principles of law then, I must determine:(1)	Whether theSOsubjectively believed that he was at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant at the time that he discharged his firearm; and,(2)	Whether that belief was objectively reasonable, or, in other words, whether his actions would be considered reasonable by an objective bystander who had all of the information available to him that theSOhad at the time that he discharged his firearm.With respect to the first of these criteria, it is clear from the statement of theSOthat he believed that he was at risk of death or grievous bodily harm at the time that he discharged his firearm.  He based that belief on his observations at the time that the Complainant was quickly advancing on him with a knife in hand, that the Complainant refused either to stop or to drop his weapon, and that the previous deployment of theCEWhad been ineffective, leaving only one option by which to effectively stop the Complainant from attacking him with the knife, that being resort to his firearm.On all of the information that theSOhad in his possession at the time he shot and killed the Complainant, I find that he, subjectively, had reasonable grounds to believe that his life was at risk from the Complainant and that his observations of the Complainant’s actions, as well as the information provided byWO#1, would have reasonably caused theSOto believe that he was at imminent risk of being seriously injured, if not killed, by the Complainant.In considering the reasonableness of theSO’s actions and whether or not he considered the use of less lethal use of force options before resorting to his firearm, theSOindicated in his statement, and he was heard on the communications recording, instructing the Complainant to drop his weapons, which appeared to have fallen on deaf ears.  He also stated, as confirmed by several of the independentCWs, the evidence located at the scene, and theCEWdownload data, that he had already resorted to the only other less lethal use of force option (theCEW) available to stop the Complainant, which either because of the heavy clothing worn by the Complainant, or perhaps because of the insulating tape which he had applied all over his body, had proven ineffective, thereby leaving only his firearm as a viable alternative.  On that basis, it is clear that theSO, in the brief seven seconds or less available to him after he had deployed hisCEW, and while the Complainant was quickly advancing upon him with a deadly weapon, appears to have considered all of his options before discharging his firearm.I have described the knife in the possession of the Complainant as a deadly weapon, which I have done after noting that the knife recovered appears quite small in size, with the blade being described as being 5 cm in length.  While there may be some who believe that this small of a knife was not a serious threat to the life or safety of theSO, I wish to indicate that I have no hesitation whatsoever in finding that the Complainant was quite capable of inflicting serious bodily injury, if not death, had he been allowed to continue to advance upon theSOto a point where he could use the weapon against theSO.  In this regard, I take specific note of the facts as outlined in the decision of R v Lenard Phillips, (1995) OJ No. 4152 OGD, wherein Mr. Phillips was convicted of using a small pen knife to murder Cst Eric Nystedt, which Mr. Phillips used to stab Cst Nystedt in the thigh, thereby avoiding his body armour, nicking his femoral artery, and causing his almost immediate death from exsanguination.  That knife was even smaller than the knife in the possession of the Complainant.With respect to whether or not there were objectively reasonable grounds to believe that the life of theSOwas at risk, one need only refer to the evidence ofCW#1, who exited his vehicle when he observed that theSOwas in trouble and might require his assistance, ofCW#3, who described the Complainant as “full running at the officer”, ofCW#8 who observed the Complainant raise his hands above his shoulders and then advance on theSO, or ofCW#2, who observed theSObacking away from the Complainant, following which the Complainant lunged at him.Additionally, one has to consider the evidence ofWO#2, who had to pry the knife out of the Complainant’s strong grip after he had been shot, confirming that when the independent witnesses saw the Complainant advancing on  theSO, he was indeed armed with a weapon, and the evidence ofWO#1, who when earlier faced with the Complainant lunging at him with knives in hand, backed away and behind his police cruiser; a luxury, unfortunately, that theSOdid not have when the Complainant lunged at him as he backed up in the deep snow.I note that in his interview,WO#1 specifically indicated that from his observations as he ran toward theSOand the Complainant, he believed that theSO’s life was in jeopardy, or that he faced the possibility of being seriously injured by the Complainant, and he believed that theSOhad no other option available to him than to discharge his firearm at that point in time.Further, while I cannot say what was in the Complainant’s mind when he lunged at theSO, it is notable that theSIUfound a “what to do” list written on an address book page that was in the Complainant’s discarded knapsack near the ambulance bay.  While there is no way to determine when the list was made or if the thoughts expressed in the “What to do” list were serious (or, if serious, whether the list was intended to be acted on contemporaneously), I note that among other violent things referred to on that list was the first item, “kill every cop in town”.  While theSOwould not have known about the list, it informs my deliberation to the effect that there was a good possibility that when he advanced on theSO, the Complainant’s intentions would not have been, or certainly would not have appeared to be, benign.[5]Having extensively reviewed all of the evidence, and the law relating to the justification in using force intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm when one believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for one’s self-preservation from death or grievous bodily harm, I find in all the circumstances that theSOreasonably believed that his life was in danger from the Complainant and his actions in firing upon the Complainant were justified.  I find that it would have been foolish and reckless for theSOto risk his life by waiting for the Complainant, with knife in hand, to further close the gap between himself and theSO, particularly in the deep snow and having limited mobility, thereby putting his own life at immediate risk of serious injury or death.  I further find that that risk was not one that theSOought to have had to take when faced with a knife yielding 6’3,” 183 pound man.I find, therefore, on this record, that the shots that were fired by theSO, which struck and killed the Complainant, were justified pursuant to ss.25 (1) and (3) of theCriminal Codeand that theSO, in preserving himself from death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant, used no more force than was necessary to affect his lawful purpose.  As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by theSO, despite the tragic loss of life, fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	October 18, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=108
,Ontario Provincial Police,Aurora,Ontario,The Complainant was later diagnosed with a fractured wrist and ankle,"TheSIU’s investigation into this incident consisted of an interview with the Complainant, Civilian Witness (CW) #1, theSOand the Witness Officer (WO). An off-duty officer (CW#2) who witnessed the incident was also interviewed by the York Regional Police and his statement was reviewed.  After considering the totality of the evidence, I believe the Complainant was the architect of her own misfortune when she decided to drive erratically (while possibly impaired) and I am unable to find that theSOcommitted a criminal offence in relation to the collision.On February 1, 2018, at approximately 10:00 p.m., theSOwas operating his markedOPPcruiser in King City, heading westbound on King Road. King Road has two westbound lanes of traffic and there is an additional westbound lane for left turning vehicles at the intersection of King Road and Stan Roots Street. TheSOtold theSIUthat he was in the passing lane (the middle westbound lane), approaching Stan Roots Street, when he observed a Honda CRV driven by the Complainant travelling southbound on Stan Roots Street. The Complainant disobeyed a red traffic light at the intersection and turned eastbound into the westbound turn lane of King Road. The Complainant veered away from the median to avoid a road sign then returned to the passing lane, passing within inches of theSO’s police cruiser. TheSOsaid he decided to stop the Complainant as she had committed multipleHighway Traffic Act(HTA) offences so he activated his emergency lights and performed a U-turn. He followed her briefly eastbound, driving in the eastbound lane of King Road, but the Complainant veered to avoid another road sign and she then headed towards the exit of a gas station where she struck a concrete pillar.In my opinion, theSOis a credible and reliable witness. I believe he is telling the truth because his statement is consistent with the remainder of the evidence. The subject officer’s statement was entirely corroborated by an off-duty York Regional Police (YRP) officer who witnessed theSO’s behaviour prior to the collision. TheSOalso spoke with theWOof theYRPafter the collision and made a statement about the incident which was predominately consistent with what he told theSIU. Moreover, and most significantly, theSO’s statement was consistent with theCDRdata from the Complainant’s vehicle and theAVLdata from theSO’s police cruiser – which confirmed that theSOdid not follow the Complainant at a high speed and that theSOhad only followed the Complainant for a matter of seconds before she collided with the concrete pillar. I accordingly accept theSO’s account of the incident.In circumstances such as these the only criminal charge that warrants consideration is dangerous driving causing bodily harm contrary to 249(3) of theCriminal Code. In R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that this offence requires that “the driving be dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place”; furthermore, the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances.” I do not believe any aspect of this test is made out. The uncontradicted evidence establishes that theSOsimply performed a U-turn and followed the Complainant eastbound in the eastbound lane. The traffic was light and there is no evidence that the conditions made it unsafe to perform the U-turn. TheSOactivated his lights to signal his presence to other vehicles, which was confirmed by theAVLdata from his police cruiser. TheAVLdata also confirmed that theSOoperated his police cruiser at an unremarkable speed, travelling up to 34 km/hr after he completed his U-turn which was well within King Road’s speed limit of 50 km/hr. In my opinion this manner of driving falls well short of the standard required for dangerous driving. Nor does it demonstrate a departure from the standard of a reasonable police officer – let alone a marked departure. Attempting to stop the Complainant, who had committed multipleHTAoffences and was actively creating a risk of harm to herself and others by driving erratically on the wrong side of the road was entirely appropriate and reasonable. The manner in which theSOattempted to do so did not depart from the standard of care expected of a reasonable officer in theSO’s circumstances.Furthermore, I am unable to find that theSO’s driving contributed to the collision. There is no evidence that the Complainant was even aware theSOwanted to stop her and as a result, there is no way to find that theSO’s actions contributed to the collision.In sum, as I believe theSO’s driving was not dangerous, was reasonable and did not contribute to the collision, I am unable to form grounds to believe he committed a criminal offence in relation to the allegation.

,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,It is alleged that the Complainant sustained this injury when he was punched in the face by one of the officers,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=155
,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,He was transported to a hospital where he was diagnosed with a mild concussion,"TheSIUwas not notified of this incident until the Complainant filed a complaint with theOIPRD. In furtherance of its investigation, theSIUinterviewed the Complainant, two civilian witnesses and seven witness officers.ICCSand booking videos from the Complainant’s arrest were also reviewed. Despite this evidence, several important details of this incident remain uncertain and I am therefore unable to form reasonable grounds to believe that either subject officer committed a criminal offence in relation to the Complainant’s allegation.The Complainant was previously charged with public mischief and released on bail with a condition that he not attend York University’s campus at 4700 Keele Street, Toronto. At the time of the incident, he was also the subject of an arrest warrant for failing to appear to court.TheTPSbecame aware of the Complainant after a York University security official called 911 to report a trespassing individual at Osgoode Hall. At around 10:45 a.m.SO#1 andSO#2 arrived at Osgoode Hall and attempted to arrest the Complainant. The Complainant allegedly reacted by going limp and dropping to the floor. The officers dragged the Complainant from the area and the Complainant was allegedly bumped into a wall, hitting an unknown part of his body. He was then taken outside where he was placed on the ground.SO#2 put his foot on the Complainant’s back because he had concerns for officer safety, and removed his foot whenWO#1 arrived and said that the Complainant did not appear to be a threat. The Complainant was then placed into the back of a police cruiser where he kicked at the interior of the cruiser.After careful consideration of the evidence, I am unable to conclude that either officer committed a criminal offence in relation to the Complainant’s allegation because there is simply insufficient evidence to support the allegation. It is alleged that the Complainant was intentionally bumped into a wall causing his concussion, but I do not believe the Complainant is a credible witness. The Complainant made a number of additional allegations against the subject officers that were not substantiated by the civilian witnesses who witnessed the arrest and did not describe any overly aggressive use of force against the Complainant. I believe the civilian witnesses, who were independent of both the Complainant and the subject officers. The Complainant’s inconsistencies with the civilian witnesses are significant because they suggest that the Complainant has misrepresented or exaggerated the officers’ actions. I am accordingly unwilling to attribute much weight to the allegation that the Complainant was intentionally swung into the wall.On the remainder of the evidence, I am unable to find that either subject officer committed an assault or was criminally negligent in relation to the allegation. Assault causing bodily harm is made out where a person intentionally applies force to another person, without the consent of that person, and that force causes bodily harm. While I believe that the Complainant was bumped into a wall, it is unclear what part of the Complainant’s body hit the wall and whether the bump occurred because of gratuitous force or an accident. Two civilian witnesses saw the bump although their description of the bump was equivocal and does not establish that it was intentional.I will now consider whether a subject officer committed criminal negligence in relation to the bump. Criminal negligence does not require intentional force and instead requires conduct that shows a wanton or reckless disregard for the safety of others and a “marked and substantial departure from the standard of a reasonable [person] in the circumstances” (R. v. Sharp(1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 428 (Ont. C.A.)).  This is a high threshold that is not met on these facts. It was absolutely reasonable for the officers to carry the Complainant out of Osgoode Hall because he refused to leave and there is simply no evidence that the conduct of the officers departed from the standard of the reasonable police officer, let alone demonstrated a wanton and reckless disregard for the Complainant’s safety.I am further satisfied that the remainder of the force used against the Complainant does not give rise to criminal culpability. Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are permitted to use force reasonably necessary in the execution of their lawful duties. The officers were clearly acting within the execution of their lawful duties when they arrested the Complainant because he was subject to an arrest warrant. There is no doubt that force was used to pick the Complainant up, carry him outside and place him in the police cruiser. This effort left the officers sweaty and out of breath. While waiting for the police cruiser to arrive,SO#2 placed his foot on the Complainant’s back because he thought the Complainant was a threat. I am mindful thatWO#1 thought the Complainant was not a threat after he was arrested and thatSO#2 did not need to put his foot on the Complainant’s back to safely restrain him. I am also mindful that the jurisprudence on use of force clearly states that the standard to which officers are to be held is not perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206) nor are police officers expected to measure the degree of their responding force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter(1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.). After a careful review of the circumstances, includingSO#2’s awareness that the Complainant was at risk of acting unpredictably and drastically[1], I am satisfied that the subject officers’ use of force during the arrest did not exceed the amount of force permitted by law.In closing, I am unable to find reasonable grounds to believe that either subject officer committed a criminal offence in relation to the arrest because there is insufficient evidence establishing the act was intentional or criminally negligent. I have also considered the remainder of the force used during the arrest and find it within the scope permitted by law.

,,Durham,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant was found to have sustained a fracture to his right ankle,"On the evening of January 31, 2018, the Complainant was in south Oshawa andCW#1 offered to drive him home.CW#1 was driving a grey 4-door Kia vehicle and, en route, purportedly stopped to use the washroom at a bar on the northeast corner of Highway 2 and Townline Road in Oshawa.  Unbeknownst to the Complainant andCW#1,WO#1 andWO#4 of theDRPS, were on duty in an unmarked police vehicle, in the parking lot of the bar, which was suspected by theDRPSto be frequented by drug dealers and impaired drivers.[1]At 12:10 a.m.,WO#1 noticed a 4-door grey Kia enter the parking lot and double park with the driving lights remaining on.WO#1 witnessed the driver,CW#1, exit the Kia, leaving the vehicle idling, and walking toward the front door of the bar.CW#1 approached and spoke briefly with an unknown man who had walked out of the bar. Both men continued to talk, while walking to, and entering, a second vehicle that was parked right next to the entrance to the bar.WO#1 observed that after approximately 30 seconds,CW#1 exited the vehicle, walked into the bar for approximately 40 seconds, and jogged back to the Kia.CW#1 started to drive out of the parking lot and approached the exit to the area of Townline Road and Nash Road in Oshawa. As a result of his observations,WO#1 thought that what he had just witnessed was a possible drug transaction.WO#4 contacted the police dispatcher to have a marked police cruiser attend the scene to assist.WO#4 further reported a silver[2]coloured vehicle leaving the parking lot of the bar and requested theSOandWO#2 to stop the suspicious vehicle. At approximately 12:18 a.m.,WO#1 sawWO#2 and theSOmove their markedDRPScruiser in front ofCW#1’s vehicle.WO#1 observed both constables conversing with the occupants of the Kia for approximately one minute whenCW#1 suddenly drove off toward Townline Road.WO#1 witnessed bothWO#2 and theSOsprint back to their cruiser.  They then activated both their emergency lights and sirens, pulled onto Townline Road, and drove northbound, in pursuit of the fleeing Kia.[3]On the evening of January 31, 2018, and into the early morning hours of February 1, 2018, theSOwas behind the wheel of a markedDRPScruiser andWO#2 was his passenger.WO#2 was aware thatWO#1 andWO#4 were operating “undercover” in the area of Townline Road and Highway 2, looking for potential drug dealers and impaired drivers possibly frequenting a bar in that area.WO#2 and theSOparked their cruiser.Shortly after midnight, the grey coloured Kia exited the bar’s parking lot and proceeded toward Townline Road.  TheSOpartially blocked the vehicle as it was about to leave the bar.The Complainant recalled that the police cruiser pulled in front of the Kia on a 45-degree angle to the left front of the Kia.Both constables exited their cruiser.WO#2 approached the driver of the Kia,CW#1.  TheSOapproached the Complainant, who was in the front passenger seat.WO#2 noted a strong odour of freshly burnt marijuana emanating from within the Kia and further noted thatCW#1 appeared exceptionally nervous.  Both constables had very brief conversations withCW#1 and the Complainant.WO#2 requested thatCW#1 produce his driver’s license. In response,CW#1 produced his Ontario Health Insurance Card, and whenWO#2 repeated his request,CW#1 said he did not have a driver’s licence.WO#2 instructedCW#1 to exit the vehicle; the Complainant was about to exit the front passenger door at the same time when, suddenly,CW#1 accelerated and turned right onto Townline Road and sped off. TheSOwas forced to jump away from the accelerating Kia to avoid being struck. Both constables quickly returned to their cruiser to give chase. The speed of the fleeing Kia motor vehicle as it accelerated out of the parking lot was estimated to be 100 km/h.The Kia was speeding northbound on Townline Road and, by the time theSOturned the cruiser onto Townline Road, and was between 300 and 500 metres ahead of the police cruiser.  The topography of Townline Road was straight, mostly level, with good visibility, and a mix of both rural and residential properties.  Throughout the pursuit, the traffic on Townline Road was virtually non-existent.WO#2 notified the dispatcher that a police pursuit had been initiated.  TheSOaccelerated to what was announced to dispatch to be 110 km/h, and both constables agreed that they were driving fast enough and would not increase their speed.[4]WO#2 noted that there were three intersections with traffic control signals on the 4.3 kilometre pursuit on Townline Road.  The three intersections on Townline Road were located at Nash Road, Adelaide Street, and Taunton Road.It was the recollection ofWO#2 that the signal light was green at the intersection of both Nash Road and Adelaide Street.WO#2 observed the Kia pass two northbound vehicles at a high rate of speed, and estimated the speed of the Kia to be between 150 to 200 km/h.[5]CW#1 steadily widened the distance between his vehicle and the police cruiser throughout the pursuit.The Complainant stated that he toldCW#1 to slow down and pull over, however,CW#1 refused to do so because he did not have a driver’s licence.  As they approached Taunton Road,WO#2 believed that the Kia was about to evade them and he was prepared to discontinue the pursuit. As the Kia approached Taunton Road,WO#2 reported to the police dispatcher that at that point their police cruiser was between 700 and 1100 metres behind the Kia.[6]However, just before that, as the Kia neared the intersection of Townline Road and Taunton Road, the traffic light for northbound traffic had turned red.  The Complainant stated thatCW#1 drove through the red light, sped a very short distance through the intersection, lost control of the Kia, swerved into the east ditch immediately north of Taunton Road and, upon striking a hydro pole, the Kia flipped over in a ditch adjacent to Townline Road.On February 1, 2018,CW#2, a taxi driver, had two customers in his vehicle and was driving eastbound on Taunton Road. As he approached the intersection of Taunton Road and Townline Road, the light cycled red for east/westbound traffic and he stopped at the intersection. When the light cycled green for east/westbound traffic on Taunton Road,CW#2 started to inch forward when he observed a small grey vehicle travelling northbound on Townline Road at a high rate of speed, which he estimated to be 200 km/h, and disobey the red signal light at the intersection of Townline and Taunton Roads.  As the grey vehicle sped through the intersection,CW#2 observed it begin to wobble and, after it had travelled approximately 300 metres, it careened into the east ditch. BeforeCW#2 entered the intersection, he saw aDRPSmarked police cruiser with its roof lights activated proceeding northbound on Townline Road.CW#2 estimated that as the police cruiser approached the intersection it was travelling at a speed close to 100 km/h.CW#2 saw the police cruiser stop at the collision scene north of his location.[7]CW#2, to his great credit and because of his vigilance, hesitated prior to proceeding, despite having a green light, and prevented what could have been a catastrophic collision at the intersection of Townline and Taunton Roads.Arriving at the collision scene,WO#2 observed smoke emanating from the Kia and noted severe damage to its roof. When the cruiser reached the scene,WO#2 observed that there were possible live hydro wires dangling near the vehicle and he decided against approaching the vehicle.  The Complainant had been able to free himself from the Kia, but realized that he could not walk as a result of a significant fracture to his right ankle. The Complainant staggered out of the bushes, was arrested, handcuffed, searched, and complained that his right ankle was causing him pain.[8]Ultimately, the Complainant was transported by ambulance to hospital.The issue to be determined is whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence, specifically whether or not his driving rose to the level of dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing bodily harm in contravention of s. 249 (3) of theCriminal Code.Pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the pivotal case of R. v. Beatty,[9]s. 249 requires that in order for an offence to be made out, the driving must be dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances, “including the nature, condition, and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place” and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances.”The issue is whether the subject officer was justified in initiating and continuing a pursuit, and, in doing so, did theSO’s driving comply with theDRPSSAPpolicy.[10]During pursuits, the paramount consideration in the decision to initiate, continue, or discontinue anSAPis public and officer safety. In addition, it is clear that anSAPis the choice of last resort and is only to be considered when other alternatives are either unavailable or unsatisfactory.It is clear that noDRPSpolice vehicle was involved in this collision, either directly or indirectly. It is my conclusion, based on a review of all the evidence, including a consideration of the officer’s driving at the time of the incident, as well as the traffic and weather conditions, that the driving of theSOdid not rise to the level required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm.” Other than the peripheral fact that theSOandWO#2 stoppedCW#1 to investigate him by asking for his driver’s licence, I do not find that there is any causal connection between the actions of the subject officer and the driving ofCW#1, which directly resulted in the injury sustained by the Complainant.  I say this despite the fact that theSOat one point reached a speed of 157.8 km/h[11], because he followed theDRPSSAPpolicy and he was on the verge of terminating theSAPat the time of the collision.[12]The police pursuit was short lived, approximately 2 minutes in duration, during whichCW#1 drove straight northbound on Townline Road for 4.3 kilometres at excessive rates of speed of between, at least, 138 to 199 km/h[13]and travelled through at least one red light (at Taunton and Townline). It is my opinion that the person responsible for this incident wasCW#1, who, wanting to evade the police (perhaps because of not having a licence or for some other reason)[14], sped away from the police and lost control of the vehicle, careened into a ditch north of the intersection of Townline Road and Taunton Road, and caused the injury sustained by the Complainant.  As such, I have no reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence and no charges shall issue.Date:	November 21, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=177
,Niagara Regional Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,No injury-specific treatment was indicated or provided,"At 8:00:44 a.m. on January 31, 2018, the first of several 911 calls was received by theNRPS911 call centre.  The initial caller reported a possible impaired driver who had almost struck three other motor vehicles, before striking a red Pontiac Vibe, and then leaving the scene.  The caller described the fleeing motor vehicle as a silver Chrysler with damage on the front passenger side and indicated it was last observed passing the Laura Secord School in the City of St. Catharines.The police were immediately dispatched to the location of the motor vehicle collision and began to search for the Chrysler.  A direction was broadcast over the radio that if located, the vehicle was not to be pursued.A second caller reported that the Chrysler as now having entered the Garden City Co-op located at 397 Niagara Street.At approximately 8:30 a.m., a resident of Glenridge Avenue in St. Catharines observed the silver Chrysler stuck in a snow bank and the driver, the Complainant, out of the vehicle attempting to reattach the front licence plate.  The Complainant was described as appearing to be impaired by drugs.  The Complainant was observed to walk away from the car and slip on the concrete sidewalk, landing face down in an icy snowbank.  The Complainant was then observed knocking on doors and asking for money and gasoline.  On one occasion, after leaving a residence, the Complainant was observed weaving as he walked and falling face forward, on more than one occasion, into an icy snow bank in front of a witness’ home.At approximately 9:01 a.m., the Chrysler was located by police with the front seat passenger,CW#8, still seated in the vehicle.CW#8 was detained while the police continued to search for the Complainant.  During the course of searching for the Complainant, police located a bicycle, a bag of beer, and a set of golf clubs which had apparently been taken from a residence in the area of where the Chrysler had been abandoned.At 10:13:58 a.m., a 911 caller reported seeing a male person stumbling down St. Paul Street with what appeared to be a hunting rifle in a case.  A radio call went out that police officers were now searching for a white male carrying a long-gun case, last seen walking on St. Paul Street, near the Meridian Centre, in downtown St. Catharines.  Additional police officers were dispatched to the area.None of the witnesses who reported seeing the Complainant, following the collision with the Pontiac Vibe, observed any bleeding or injury to the Complainant, although many described him as being possibly high on drugs or impaired.At approximately 10:31 a.m., the Complainant was located bySO#1,SO#2, and Witness Officer (WO) #1, in the alcove of an abandoned store front on St. Paul Street.SO#1, who was the first out of the police vehicle, approached the Complainant and shouted, “Let me see your hands!” and, “Don’t move!”SO#2 andSO#1 then both approached the Complainant, withSO#2 to his right andSO#1 to his left.  The Complainant then raised his arms up, with his hands open and his palms toward the police officers.SO#1 took control of the Complainant’s left arm above the elbow, whileSO#2 did the same with his right arm.  Due to the presence of a possible firearm in direct proximity of the Complainant, it was decided that the best and safest course of action would be to take the Complainant to the ground, with each officer holding onto one arm and guiding him down. The Complainant was described as not actively resisting and he landed on his stomach/chest area.  At no time did the Complainant’s face impact with the ground.WO#1, a member of the Emergency Tactical Unit (ETU) who had arrived withSO#1 andSO#2, immediately recognized the carrying case which was behind the Complainant as being a fishing rod case.WO#1 described the grounding of the Complainant bySO#1 andSO#2 as with purpose, but not forceful, with one officer holding onto each of the Complainant’s arms and the Complainant landing on the ground chest first; at no time didWO#1 observe the Complainant’s head hit the ground.  Since the Complainant continued to move around, once on the ground,WO#1 placed his foot against the left side of the Complainant’s head for approximately three seconds, untilSO#1 andSO#2 were able to pull the Complainant’s hands behind his back, and he was handcuffed.WO#1 described the arrest of the Complainant as a “vanilla” arrest, or one requiring the least amount of force possible, with the Complainant’s face at no time striking the ground and no blows being delivered by any police officer present.  Furthermore, the Complainant made no complaint about his arrest, nor was any blood observed either on the Complainant or on the ground where he had been arrested.  While an ambulance was requested by police as there was a concern that the Complainant, due to his unresponsive behaviour, was either under the influence of drugs or possibly suffering from hypothermia, the Complainant was not observed to have any injury to his face either by the police officers present or by the paramedics who assessed him.  Specifically, the paramedics described the Complainant as having no obvious facial or nasal injury and no signs of fresh or dry blood on his face or nostrils, but appeared sluggish and somewhat lethargic, not alert, and somewhat drowsy. He was also described as having slurred speech and not being forthcoming with paramedics during their assessment.  One of the paramedics opined that he would have expected to see some evidence of bleeding in the nasal area secondary to a fresh nasal fracture, had he just suffered such a fracture.  Additionally, the Complainant at no time made any physical complaints to paramedics, nor did he complain of having sustained any injury, or of mistreatment by the police, his only complaint being that he was cold.Upon arrival at the hospital, due to the Complainant’s unusual and lethargic behaviour, he was sent for aCTscan of his head, during which he was discovered to have a minimally displaced fracture of the nasal bone with overlying soft tissue swelling.  The doctor who assessed the Complainant described the nasal bone fracture as being acute or sub-acute.  According to the website of www.cindyprocterrmt.com, the acute or inflammatory stage of an injury refers to that which occurs immediately after an injury is sustained, while the sub-acute stage refers to the stage wherein some healing is already taking place, including bruising turning yellow, green, or brown, and inflammation decreasing.  On this basis, it is impossible to determine if the Complainant’s injury occurred on January 31, 2018, or sometime prior (or if he perhaps re-aggravated a recent injury).While the Complainant, in his interview withSIUinvestigators, indicated that he was approached at approximately 12:00 p.m. on January 31, 2018, in the area of St. Paul Street in downtown St. Catharines, by six police officers, and was thrown to the ground, he had no information as to why they approached him and could provide no information as to what had occurred prior to his arrest.  The Complainant did confirm, however, that he was on his abdomen on the sidewalk and that he was later taken to the hospital for his nasal bone injury.The Complainant opined that his nose was broken when the police officers crushed his face into the concrete, and indicated that his nose was bleeding at the time, following which he was picked up and thrown into a police car.  While the evidence of both paramedics is consistent with that of the three police witnesses, that there was absolutely no evidence that the Complainant’s nose had been bleeding subsequent to his arrest, combined with the very little detail that the Complainant could recall of the incident itself, I find that I am unable to place any reliance on the evidence of the Complainant, which appears to be more along the lines of his attempting to piece together what had occurred, rather than an actual accurate recollection.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are immune from criminal liability when they use force if they are acting in furtherance of their lawful duties, and if they use only as much force as is reasonably necessary to effect their lawful purpose.  On this record, I have no hesitation in finding that bothSO#1 andSO#2 were carrying out their lawful duties in apprehending a male for whom they were in possession of information which provided them with reasonable grounds to believe that he had been involved in a motor vehicle collision, that he had failed to remain at the scene of the collision, and that he had been seen walking down the street with what was broadcast as a long gun in his possession.  As such, the actions ofSO#1 andSO#2 in arresting the Complainant were lawful, based on reasonable grounds, and in accordance with their duties.I further have no hesitation in finding that while the Complainant was in a confined space, being the store alcove, and in close proximity to what had been described to police as a gun case containing a long gun, that the police officers dealing with the Complainant would have been under some considerable pressure to deal with the Complainant as quickly as possible in removing him from the alcove, where he was in close proximity to the perceived gun case.I am also of the view that the grounding resorted to bySO#1 andSO#2 was a reasonable option available to the police officers to apprehend a suspect who had already fled the scene of a motor vehicle collision, was very likely involved in breaking and entering into at least one residence, from which he obtained the bicycle and the property in his possession, and was now in close proximity to what appeared to be a firearm case.  In these circumstances, I cannot find thatSO#1 andSO#2, who were described by a witness officer as taking the Complainant to the ground in a controlled fashion, with each officer holding onto one arm and lowering him to the ground, and with the Complainant’s head or face at no time striking the ground, that either ofSO#1 orSO#2 resorted to any more than the minimal force required and no more than was reasonably necessary to achieve their lawful purpose.In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]I further find that the evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant’s injury was caused by the police officers who apprehended and arrested him.It is clear on all of the evidence that at no time, as would have been expected had the Complainant’s nose just been fractured, was there any sign that the Complainant had sustained an injury to his nose or face, as there was an absolute absence of any bleeding, redness, or bruising.  While it is very possible that the Complainant injured his nose when he fell several times on the concrete sidewalk and into an icy snow bank, landing face down, when he was leaving his motor vehicle and thereafter as he was going door to door, as observed by a number of independent witnesses, the lack of any sign of injury whatsoever to the Complainant’s face, and the observation by the attending physician that the Complainant’s injury could have been either in the acute or sub-acute phase, I find it more likely that this injury was pre-existing and the Complainant, due to the minimal displacement, was simply unaware that his nose had been fractured.  I find support in this conclusion in the fact that at no time following his arrest did the Complainant make any complaint, either to the police, paramedics, or medical staff, as noted in his medical records, of any injury to his face or nose, or any rough treatment, or mistreatment, by the police.Even had the Complainant ’s nose been fractured, however, when he was taken to the ground by the police in what was described as both a controlled manner and the safest method by which to constrain and arrest the Complainant, which I find highly unlikely as there is no evidence that his face, head, or nose ever struck the ground, I am still of the opinion that this evidence is not capable of providing me with reasonable grounds to believe that the actions of the police amounted to an excessive or unjustified use of force on these facts.In conclusion, on this record, I find that the evidence does not satisfy me either that any police officer dealing with the Complainant on January 31, 2018 resorted to an excessive use of force, or that the Complainant’s injury was sustained at the hands of the police, or even that it was sustained on the date of this incident.  As I therefore lack the bases for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	November 21, 2018Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=148
,Stratford Police Service,Stratford,Ontario,The third passenger left hospital before speaking with investigators and did not consent to release his medical records and therefore his injuries remain unconfirmed,"On January 31, 2018, theSOwas dealing with an unrelated vehicle stop, when he was notified to attend the area of Romeo Street in the City of Stratford to investigate an unrelated matter.  TheSO, upon arriving on Romeo Street, observed a Jeep Compass motor vehicle driving without its taillights illuminated.  TheSOaccelerated his police vehicle in order to catch up to the Jeep and inform the driver that he may have inadvertently failed to turn on the full lighting system.As theSOneared the Jeep Compass, on Norfolk Street in the area of Laurier Street, he activated his emergency lighting system in order to alert the driver of the Jeep that he was conducting a vehicle stop.  Within a second or less of activating his emergency lighting system, the driver of the Jeep,CW#1, accelerated and then attempted to negotiate a left turn onto Taylor Street, losing control of his vehicle, mounting the curb on Taylor Street, crossing over the sidewalk and striking a tree, where the Jeep came to rest.CW#1 then fled from the vehicle, leaving behind his three passengers.The evidence of theSOthat he only activated his emergency lighting system after the intersection of Norfolk Street and Laurier Street, some six to seven houses before the intersection of Norfolk and Taylor Streets, is consistent with the evidence of the occupants of the Jeep Compass.  Complainant #1 indicated that as soon as she observed that a police vehicle was behind their vehicle, with his emergency lighting but no siren activated,CW#1 sped up, lost control, and hit the tree.  Complainant #1 estimated the distance between her seeing the police car with its emergency lighting activated, andCW#1 striking the tree, was approximately the length of four residential homes and a period of approximately seven seconds.  Similarly, Complainant #2 indicated that immediately after she observed the police car, with emergency lighting activated, behind them,CW#1 accelerated and drove directly into a tree while attempting a left turn, withCW#1indicating that he estimated the distance that he travelled after seeing the police car and before he struck the tree, as being only some six feet.Furthermore,CW#1 opined that he lost control of his motor vehicle not due to any actions by theSO, but rather due to the recent snowfall which had accumulated on the roadway.TheGPS/AVLdata from theSO’s police vehicle further confirmed not only that the time that both vehicles travelled forward, after he activated his emergency lighting system, was only, at most, 15 seconds (from point 36 to point 38 on theAVLchart), but far more likely five seconds (from point 36 to point 37 on theAVLchart) but also that after theSOactivated his emergency lighting system, rather than accelerating to catch up to the Jeep Compass, the police cruiser was slowed from 53 and then to 45 km/h, decelerating even further then to 16, 12, 11, and then 9 km/h, presumably as a result of the Jeep colliding with the tree.On this record, it is clear that at the time thatCW#1 crashed his motor vehicle into the tree on Taylor Street, he was not being pursued by theSO.  In fact, as soon as theSOobserved that the Jeep Compass was not going to stop, but instead was accelerating away from the police vehicle, rather than initiate a pursuit, theSOslowed his police vehicle.  Notwithstanding the actions of theSO, however,CW#1, in his efforts to flee from the police, took the left turn at an apparently unsafe speed and in less than ideal road and weather conditions, and crashed his vehicle.In conclusion, while theSOwas acting completely within his lawful duties when he activated his emergency lighting system to alertCW#1 to pull over in order that he could advise him that he had failed to activate the full lighting system on his vehicle, the actions ofCW#1 in accelerating and taking a left turn too quickly thereby causing the single vehicle collision, were unforeseeable and there is no causal connection between the actions of theSOand the subsequent collision and consequent injuries.  It is clear on the evidence that at no time did theSOengage the Jeep Compass in a vehicular pursuit, and that theSO’s response to the fleeing motor vehicle fell well within the limits of the criminal law, and there is no basis whatsoever for proceeding with criminal charges against the subject officer in this case, and the file is closed.Date:	November 16, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=175

,Ontario Provincial Police,Douro-Dummer,Ontario,nCause of Death The post-mortem report listed the cause of death as a “Submental the area underneath the chin Gunshot Wound to Head,"Through theGPSfeature of the Complainant’s cell phone, and after contacting the Complainant’s employer, in whose name the phone was registered, the police were able to pinpoint the location of the Complainant at his residence in Douro-Dummer Township, in Youngs Point.While police officers were en route, Subject Officer (SO) #1, a trained negotiator, took over the call with the Complainant in attempts to deter the Complainant from ending his life.SO#1 spoke with the Complainant on the telephone for seven minutes, while constantly attempting to engage with him and establish some type of rapport.  During the course of the call, the Complainant revealed that his domestic relationship had recently ended, his children were estranged from him, he had been charged with drinking and driving on Boxing Day, and that he feared that he would lose his job as a result.WhileSO#1 was still on the telephone with the Complainant,SO#2 arrived at the Complainant’s residence and entered the home through the unlocked basement door; no other police officers had yet arrived at that time.This is confirmed by the communications recording, whereinSO#2 is heard to report, “I’m in the basement, I can hear him upstairs on the phone with somebody.”SO#2 then called out to the Complainant, from the basement, that he was a police officer and that he was there to help.  This is confirmed by the recording of the call betweenSO#1 and the Complainant, as well as bySO#1 who heard someone speaking to the Complainant in the background.The presence of a uniformed police officer at his residence, however, appeared to agitate the Complainant, who was then heard shouting at someone in the background of the telephone call.AsSO#2 came up from the basement stairs, he observed the Complainant seated on a couch in the living room speaking on a cell phone with a .22 calibre rifle in his hands, with the muzzle pointing up and about one inch from the underside of his chin.SO#2 had the impression that the Complainant was distraught, had formulated a plan to kill himself, and was not about to let anyone prevent him from doing so.WhileSO#2 had originally drawn his service pistol and held it at the low ready position, hidden from the Complainant, so as not to frighten him, when the Complainant became upset,SO#2 holstered his firearm and showed the Complainant that his hands were empty.  The Complainant was then observed to put the cell phone on the coffee table, on speaker, and move the muzzle of his rifle to a point under his chin, when he began to count down from three.SO#2 then heardSO#1’s voice over the speaker on the cell phone.SO#2 advised that this was when he first became aware that the Complainant was in conversation with a trained negotiator.As a result of the Complainant’s upset at his presence,SO#2 removed himself from the Complainant’s line of sight and hid behind the kitchen wall.  Once concealed behind the kitchen counter, he drew his conducted energy weapon (CEW), in case the opportunity should present itself to disable the Complainant, thereby preventing him from discharging his firearm.SO#2 also radioed in to the communications centre that he was disengaging from the Complainant, as the Complainant appeared agitated by his presence.The 911 call confirms the Complainant’s agitation when he is heard to shout, “Get away, you get away from me.  I told you, get away from me,” andSO#2 is heard to respond, “Look at me.  (Complainant’s first name), my name’s (SO#2’s first name).  I’m not going to come any closer.”  Additionally, the communications recording hadSO#2 reporting, “He’s speaking to … I think it’sSO#1 there out of Orillia, but I’m not sure.  He can see … he’s got eyes on me and he doesn’t want me to come any closer so I’m just in the kitchen.  He’s sitting in the living room, has the gun to his chin now.”SO#2 advised dispatch that he heard the Complainant continue to speak withSO#1 for some minutes, when Witness Officer (WO) #1 andWO#2 arrived outside of the residence.SO#2 is heard to indicate over the radio, “ …You guys that just showed up on scene, make sure your repeaters are off.  Just hang in there in the basement there for a minute, he’s pretty excited here.”WO#1, with his firearm drawn, then joinedSO#2 behind the kitchen wall.SO#2 looked around the wall at the Complainant and heard the Complainant apologize toSO#1 on the telephone.This is confirmed by the 911 call, wherein the Complainant is recorded as saying, “I know what you are trying to do.  One … I’m sorry (SO#1’s first name), I’m so sorry,” at which point a noise is heard.SO#2 then observed the Complainant to discharge his rifle, one time, to the underside of his chin.Immediately thereafter, the communications recording hadSO#2 reporting, “…Male just shot himself in the head.”SO#2 andWO#1 then immediately ran to the Complainant to administer lifesaving manoeuvres; they were joined shortly thereafter byWO#2.The communications recording hasSO#2 reporting, “We have him in the recovery position here, but it’s not looking good.”Shortly thereafter,EMSarrived; the Complainant wasVSAand a doctor from the hospital advised the paramedic to cease resuscitative efforts.One .22 shell casing was located in the living room at the feet of the Complainant, as was the rifle.  No police officer discharged his firearm orCEWat any time.A subsequent post-mortem examination carried out on the body of the Complainant confirmed the cause of death as a “Submental (in the area under the chin) Gunshot Wound to Head,” meaning the gunshot originated from under his chin, which was consistent with the observations ofSO#2 and the 911 call recording wherein the Complainant indicated that he had the rifle “under my chin.”An examination of the scene bySIUFIs located 11 handwritten notes authored by the Complainant wherein he bequeaths his property to various parties, he apologizes to loved ones, and he outlines the circumstances which brought him to consider suicide, including the breakdown of his marriage, his arrest for drinking and driving, and the estrangement of his children and grandchildren.  The Complainant set out parting words for those he loved and those he did not.  In his suicide note, the Complainant begins with “So this (sic) a note I have dreaded my life.  If the police are reading this, I am not around.” He goes on to write, “So now is the hardest thing I need to put on paper … I am so sorry I let you down,” and finally, “So why go on?  I called a hotline and they put me on hold.”It is clear, on a review of all of the evidence, that the Complainant had decided to take his own life and had planned and taken all steps to carry out his intention, from writing out a suicide note and what would qualify as a will, to contacting the police in order that his friends and family not be the ones to locate his body, and to loading and arming himself with a rifle.   On all of the evidence, it is clear that the Complainant was struggling due to some recent incidents in his life which he apparently felt he could not overcome.  While the Complainant appears to have sought out some resources to counsel him and help him to deal with his situation in the days leading up to his death, including apparently the suicide hotline and the police, in the end it is clear that he was unable to come to terms with his situation and decided to end his life.  While it is tragic that the Complainant felt that he was finally pushed to the brink, which caused him to resort to the drastic decision to end his own life, it is clear that the officers tasked with attempting to save the life of the Complainant, most specificallySO#1 andSO#2, acted to try to save that life.On all of the evidence, it is clear that the Complainant took his own life without any intervention by the police.  It is further clear that the Complainant, with the rifle always near at hand and, afterSO#2 arrived, with the barrel touching the area under his chin, left the police with no options to which they could resort to attempt to disarm the Complainant, other than to try and convince him to abandon his plan.The only criminal charge open for consideration on these facts would be one of criminal negligence causing death contrary to s.220 of theCriminal Code.  There is no dispute that the death of the Complainant was not in any way attributable to the actions ofSO#2 orSO#1, the only question being whether or notSO#2 orSO#1 failed in their duty toward the Complainant.  Specifically, the question to be posed is whetherSO#2 orSO#1 omitted to do anything that it was their duty to do and, in failing to do so, showed a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of the Complainant (s.219 of theCriminal Code:  definition of criminal negligence).There are numerous decisions of the higher courts defining the requirements to prove an offence of criminal negligence; while most relate to offences involving driving, the courts have made it clear that the same principles apply to other behaviour as well.  In order to find reasonable grounds to believe thatSO#2 orSO#1 committed the offence of criminal negligence causing death, one must first have reasonable grounds to believe that they had a duty toward the Complainant which they omitted to carry out, and that omission, pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v J.F.(2008), 3 S.C.R. 215, represented ‘a marked and substantial departure  from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in circumstances’ whereSO#2 orSO#1 ‘either recognized and ran an obvious and serious risk to the life’ of the Complainant ‘or, alternatively, gave no thought to that risk’.  The courts have also made clear that the risk of death to the Complainant must have been foreseeable in the circumstances (R. v Shilon(2006), 240 C.C.C. (3d) 401 Ont. C.A.).On this evidence, I cannot find that the actions of eitherSO#2 orSO#1 amounted to an omission to carry out their duties, nor did they amount to ‘a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances’.  While the intentions of the Complainant, as outlined by him in the 911 call and his actions in arming himself with a rifle, the barrel of which he held firmly under his chin, would clearly have made his suicide foreseeable, I cannot find that the police service, orSO#2 andSO#1 specifically, could possibly have done more than they did to prevent the Complainant’s death.Rather than reasonable grounds to believe thatSO#2 and/orSO#1 showed a wanton and reckless disregard for the life or safety of the Complainant, it appears that they were in fact actively seeking to assist him and to prevent his taking his own life.  In all, the actions taken by theOPPwere swift and appropriately responsive.  Unfortunately, the Complainant had clearly made up his mind to end his life and he too acted swiftly afterSO#2 had arrived, and beforeSO#1 could talk him out of taking his life orSO#2 orWO#1 could take any action to save that life, and he discharged his rifle, thereby ending his own life and thwarting the efforts of the police to the contrary.On this record, I cannot find reasonable grounds to believe that the actions of either ofSO#2 orSO#1, or any of the police officers who responded to the Complainant’s suicide call, satisfy any of the elements required in order to pursue a charge under s.220 of theCriminal Codein that they neither omitted to carry out any duty to act; nor did their actions amount to a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in their circumstances; and they did not show a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of the Complainant.  Additionally, despite their best efforts, it was not within the power of either officer to prevent the Complainant’s subsequent and tragic death.On all of the evidence, it is clear that the death of the Complainant was as a result of his own voluntary actions, obviously largely influenced by his depressed state of mind brought about by recent unfortunate downturns in his life, and there is no causal connection between the actions ofSO#2, orSO#1, and the death of the Complainant.  On this record, I can find no basis for the laying of criminal charges nor any basis for the assignment of blame, and no charges shall issue.Date:	January 10, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=192
,Belleville Police Service,Belleville,Ontario,The Complainant was then transferred to a second hospital where it was determined that he had not in fact sustained a skull fracture but that he possibly had a concussion with a loss of consciousness noted,"As a result, at 7:37:56 p.m., two police units were dispatched, with theSOarriving first at the residence at 7:41:37 p.m., almost simultaneously with the paramedic services.While theSOopted not to provide a statement toSIUinvestigators, he did relate the details of the incident to several witnesses following the injury to the Complainant.  The various utterances made by theSOare fully consistent with the evidence of the two paramedic witnesses, the medical records, and the limited recall of the Complainant.  There is no dispute as to the facts.Upon arrival at the residence, the Complainant was observed to be lying on the floor with a towel over his head, which was covered with blood.  There were also significant amounts of blood seen throughout the kitchen and dining room area of the residence.  A second occupant of the apartment advised paramedics and the police that the Complainant was in a drunken rage and had smashed either a bottle or a glass on his own forehead, resulting in lacerations to his forehead and scalp, causing her to call 911.CW#2, an Advanced Care Paramedic, approached the Complainant and touched his right shoulder, following which the Complainant immediately sprang up from the floor, grabbed a broom, and began to swing the stick end of the broom at the two paramedics to keep them back.  The Complainant was also observed to be verbally abusive towardCW#2, while swinging and/or jabbing the handle of the broom at her.TheSOthen intervened and yelled at the Complainant to put the broom down, while placing himself between the paramedics and the Complainant.  TheSOthen grabbed the broom away from the Complainant.  The Complainant was then described as continuing his aggressive behaviour while theSOwas trying to reason with him.The Complainant then reached toward a kitchen drawer, which the other occupant of the apartment advised was the knife drawer.TheSOyelled at the Complainant to “Stay back!” and “Don’t touch that drawer!” a number of times, but when the Complainant continued to open the drawer, theSOdrew his Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW) and discharged it twice at the Complainant, resulting in the Complainant falling and striking his head against a nearby table.  TheSOthen immediately radioed for assistance.When the knife drawer was later examined, it was noted that there was blood both on the drawer handle as well as on several of the knives inside the drawer, confirming that the Complainant had indeed managed to open the drawer and reach inside, prior to theCEWbeing deployed.CW#2 then again approached the Complainant and observed that he was now bleeding to the back of his head.  WhenCW#2 tried to assist him, the Complainant told her to “Fuck off” and commented that he liked the police officers better than he liked her.Additional police officers arrived at that point, and the Complainant was handcuffed; he was described as being verbally abusive toward all officers present, while taunting them and inviting them to fight.The Complainant was observed to have twoCEWprobes embedded in his chest and abdomen with the wires still attached to the probes at one end and theSO’sCEWat the other.While being escorted to the ambulance, the Complainant continued to be uncooperative and verbally abusive and a civilian witness heard a police officer repeatedly tell the Complainant to stop lunging at him.  Between the verbal abuse being issued by the Complainant, he was heard several times thanking theSOfor not “Fucking me up” and apologizing for his behaviour.Once at hospital, the evidence of witnesses and the medical records indicate that the Complainant continued to be non-compliant, verbally abusive, and aggressive, on one occasion attempting to bite a police officer after indicating to the officer that he had Hepatitis C andAIDS.Eventually, the Complainant was sedated in order to calm him down.The medical records confirm that the Complainant was indeed severely intoxicated, with an analysis of his blood revealing that he had 69.9 mmol of alcohol in a litre of blood (or 322 mgs of alcohol in 100 mls of blood).[1]While there was initially a suspicion that the Complainant had sustained a skull fracture, the medical records indicate that aCTscan of his head revealed:No specific features of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, large territory vascular ischemia, parenchymal contusion.Scalp hematoma overlying the left occipitoparietal region.No fracture identified.Based on these findings, it is unclear as to whether the Complainant actually sustained a serious injury.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order for the subject officer to qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear based upon the direct observations of theSO, as confirmed by the other witnesses present, that the Complainant had already armed himself with a weapon, that being the broom, and had used it in an aggressive fashion towards the paramedics.  While s. 267 (a) of theCriminal Code, which defines the offence of assault with a weapon, includes both actions and threats to use a weapon, despite the Complainant not actually striking either of the paramedics, it is clear that theSOat that point in time would have had reasonable grounds to arrest the Complainant under this provision.Furthermore, when the Complainant then moved toward the knife drawer, it is clear that he posed a threat pursuant to s. 27 of theCriminal Code(Use of Force to Prevent Commission of Offence) in that there was a real risk that he was going to arm himself and again commit the offence of assault with a weapon, and that theSO, pursuant to s. 34 (Defence of Person), had reasonable grounds to believe:34 (1) (a) that force is being used against them or another person or that a threat of force is being made against them or another person;And he acted:(b) for the purpose of defending or protecting themselves or the other person from that use or threat of force.Furthermore, the third requirement under s. 34 which would justify the actions of theSO, that being under (c) that ‘the act committed is reasonable in the circumstances’, appears also to be fully satisfied.In these circumstances, where the Complainant had already proven himself quite capable of assaulting those present with a weapon (the broom) and appeared to be moving towards arming himself with a far more dangerous weapon (a knife), after having ignored repeated requests to move away from the knife drawer and to stay away from the knives, and while his overall behaviour was aggressive, combative, and irrational, I find that the action of theSOin deploying hisCEWwas completely reasonable and in all likelihood the only effective non-lethal use of force option available to theSOto stop the Complainant before he injured or killed someone, with the only other option open to theSObeing to draw his firearm, which could obviously have had far more serious consequences should the officer have been forced to use it.On this record, while I find that the injury to the Complainant was caused by theSOdeploying hisCEWand the Complainant consequently falling and striking his head against the dining room table, I have no reluctance in finding that the actions of theSOdid not amount to an excessive use of force, but rather were both justified and necessary to prevent harm to either himself, or other persons, present in the apartment.In making this finding, I have considered the direction from the Supreme Court of Canada as set out inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.In conclusion, having found on these facts that the actions of theSOfell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law, I further find that I lack the grounds for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.Date:	November 9, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=127
,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,The Complainant was assessed and discovered to have sustained a knife injury to the left side of his chest very close to his heart,"The 911 operator asked if everything was okay, if the police were required, and if a firearm had been discharged.  While no one spoke directly to the operator, there was yelling heard in the background indicating that someone was in crisis.  After the call was again disconnected, enquiries were made of the number associated with the telephone from which the call had been made, which revealed the name, address, and the fact of a previous suicide attempt at that residence by the Complainant; consequently, police were dispatched.While the Complainant, when interviewed bySIUinvestigators, had little recall of the incident in which he sustained the injuries relevant to this report, and both subject officers declined to provide statements or their notes for review, with the assistance ofCW#1 and the witness police officers, a reliable summary of the events leading to the injuries sustained by the Complainant was able to be formulated.  There is no dispute as to the facts.On December 25, 2017,CW#1 became concerned about the Complainant’s behaviour due to a number of unusual and bizarre things that he had said and done.  During an argument betweenCW#1 and the Complainant, the Complainant went to the kitchen and grabbed two knives.CW#1 believed that she then inadvertently hit the 911 speed dial button on her cell phone, thereby contacting the police.  When her phone rang shortly thereafter, and she was questioned by the 911 operator as to what was happening and if police assistance was required, she did not know what to say, so she handed the phone to the Complainant while they continued to argue.The 911 operator believed that she heard a male voice in the background say words to the effect of “shots in front of you,” as well as hearing that the male had just texted his sister a message indicating his intention to end his life, while a female voice repeatedly yelled, “Oh my God!”After querying the telephone number, an address in the City of Brampton was obtained from the cell phone provider. Information that the address was associated with prior suicide attempts was obtained from the police database.  Police were then dispatched to investigate.Prior to the arrival of the police, the Complainant took two knives and went into the front hall of the home, where he held one knife in each hand at chest level.CW#1 sat down on the couch and spoke to the Complainant, trying to calm him.At that point, there was a knock at the door and, whenCW#1 opened the door, she discoveredSO#1,SO#2, andWO#1, and she invited them in. One of the police officers toldCW#1 that a gunshot had been reported from the home, andCW#1 informed him that there were no firearms in the house.While the Complainant recalled seeing someone at the front door, he could not recall who it was or what happened at that point.CW#1 then described the Complainant as leaping down the stairs to the basement, in a kneeling position, with the police officers following.CW#1 heard one of the police officers say, “He’s got a knife.”  WhenCW#1 went downstairs, she saw the back of one police officer, who had his arms up and extended out in front of him, saying, “Put the knife down.”WO#1 advised that upon arrival, he went to speak withCW#1 in the kitchen, whileSO#2 andSO#1 spoke to the Complainant.WO#1 observed the Complainant on his knees near the top of the basement stairs.After two or three minutes,WO#1 heard eitherSO#2 orSO#1 indicate, “He’s got a knife,” whereuponWO#1 quickly turned to look at the Complainant, heard a tripping sound, and saw the Complainant jumping down the basement stairs.WO#1 followedSO#2 andSO#1 down the stairs, and heard both officers repeatedly ordering the Complainant to drop the knife.At the bottom of the stairs,WO#1 saw the Complainant tumble backwards and heard an officer yell, “Taser” twice, whereupon he observedSO#2 andSO#1 simultaneously deploy theirCEWs, once each.TheCEWdownload data from theCEWs in the possession ofSO#2 andSO#1 at the time, confirm thatSO#2 deployed hisCEWonce at 1416:11 hours (2:16:11 p.m.) for a period of five seconds, whileSO#1 deployed hisCEWonce at 1416:33 hours (2:16:33 p.m.), for a period of seven seconds.WO#1 observed the Complainant fall onto the floor after theCEWdeployments, landing on his back at the bottom of the stairs.WO#1 observed that the Complainant had two tiny puncture wounds in his chest area and there was blood on his chest and on the floor.WO#1 andSO#1 immediately applied pressure to the wounds and an ambulance was summoned to the scene.WO#1 did not see how the Complainant was stabbed, but he heardSO#2 andSO#1 state that the Complainant had stabbed himself in front of the other officers at the bottom of the stairs when they told him to drop the knife.  This was also overheard byWO#2, who arrived to assist and located a knife (with a blade about 6 inches in length) under a chair to the left of where the Complainant had fallen, and byCW#1, who heard the officers telling the paramedics, upon their arrival, that a “Taser had been deployed” and that the Complainant had stabbed himself and had two stab wounds.The Complainant advised that he remembered rolling down the basement stairs and ending up at the bottom, where he felt a pain in his chest and, when he looked down, he saw a knife stuck in his chest.  The Complainant could not recall how the knife came to be in his chest.  The Complainant also recalled seeing someone with a badge and a yellow gun (CEW) and he did a “jig”[1]on the floor, after which he was handcuffed.  The Complainant could not recall ever having had two knives in his hands.While one can infer from the Complainant’s evidence that he was stabbed as a result of his rolling down the stairs with a knife or knives in his hand, this appears inconsistent with the injuries, which were shallow, and the presence of two stab wounds, and not the one which the Complainant described as a result of seeing the knife sticking out of his chest.On all of the evidence before me, including that of the Complainant himself, which evidence is somewhat confused, I have no hesitation in finding that the Complainant, of his own accord, either leapt or rolled down the stairs from a kneeling position at the top of the stairs, and that he either stabbed himself inadvertently, as a result of falling with knives in his hands, or deliberately, when he stabbed himself at the bottom of the stairs.  On either version, it is clear that the deployment of theCEWs neither caused nor contributed to the injuries sustained by the Complainant.I also find that the deployment of theCEWs was necessary in order to disarm the Complainant and prevent him from causing himself any further injury.Therefore, on all the evidence before me, I find that there is an absence of any evidence from which it could be inferred that the deployment of theCEWs by either ofSO#2 orSO#1 was the source of the Complainant’s injuries, or that the deployment amounted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances.While it may well be that a single deployment of aCEWmay have achieved the purpose of disarming the Complainant, I find, without reluctance, that due to the fluid and fast pace at which things were moving once the Complainant left the top of the stairs, that the officers did not have the luxury of consulting on next actions, but each almost simultaneously drew and discharged hisCEWin efforts to reduce any harm that the Complainant might inflict upon himself.In so finding, I am reminded of the dictates of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, that:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]In conclusion, I find that the police officers were legally present inside the Complainant’s home, after having been invited in byCW#1, and acting in response to the 911 call in which there had been an indication that the Complainant might be attempting to take his own life, and that they were therefore acting pursuant to their lawful duties.  I further find that their actions in deploying theirCEWs at the Complainant were reasonable, lawful, and no more than was justified and necessary in the circumstances, and their actions are therefore exempt from prosecution pursuant to s. 25 (1) of theCriminal Code.  As I lack the reasonable grounds to form the belief that either officer acted outside of the limits of the criminal law, I lack the grounds for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.Date:	November 14, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=125
,Waterloo Regional Police Service,King,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant received a minimally displaced fracture of the left pubic ramos pelvis,"TheSOturned onto Brubaker Street intending to make a U-turn in order to get behind the U-Haul and perform a traffic stop, while the U-Haul turned right onto Lancaster Street, travelling westbound. TheSOthen waited for traffic to clear, and he also turned right onto Lancaster Street East.TheGPSdata from theSO’s police vehicle confirms his speed as being 17 km/h at 4:44:01 p.m., as he approached Brubaker Street travelling eastbound on Lancaster Street East, at which point he then made his U-turn and drove back westbound on Lancaster Street.CW#6 was operating a U-Haul van on December 24, 2017, when he observed a marked police cruiser approaching from the opposite direction.CW#6 could see the police officer looking at him and he thought that theSOwas going to pull him over.CW#6 made a right turn onto Hohner Avenue and saw the police cruiser make the same turn behind him.CW#6 then sped up, increasing his speed to what he estimated was approximately 90 km/h.CW#6 observed that the police vehicle was making every turn that he made but the cruiser never got close to him.CW#6 did not hear any sirens nor did he see any emergency lights activated on the cruiser.When a white motor vehicle got between the U-Haul van and the police cruiser,CW#6 took the opportunity to increase the distance between himself and the police vehicle.  At no time did the police cruiser close the distance between it and the U-Haul.CW#2 was driving his Chevrolet Cruze on December 24, 2017, and was taking his mother, the Complainant, and his wife,CW#1, to church for Christmas Eve mass.CW#2 described the weather as snowing, it was dusk, the roads were snow covered and slippery, and the traffic was light.CW#2 was driving on Krug Street approaching the area where it intersected with Samuel Street.  Krug Street is a through street with no traffic controls; Samuel Street is governed by a stop sign.CW#2 was driving at or below the speed limit.  All of the occupants of the Chevrolet Cruze were wearing their seat belts.TheSOstated that he did not activate his emergency lighting system or siren as he did not wish to affect other motor vehicles until he was close enough to the U-Haul van to stop it.  TheSOdescribed his speed on Lancaster Street East as being about 35 km/h and estimated the distance that he travelled on Lancaster Street, until he reached Hohner Avenue, to be about 50 to 75 metres.TheGPSdata confirms that at 4:44:21 p.m., theSOmade a U-turn to drive westbound on Lancaster Street, with his initial speed registering at 11 km/h; he then accelerated to 33 km/h before turning right onto Hohner Avenue at 4:44:36 p.m.CW#7 was just entering her vehicle on Hohner Avenue when she saw the U-Haul van drive past very quickly; she estimated the speed of the U-Haul at approximately 80 km/h.CW#7 observed the U-Haul slow at the stop sign at Samuel Street, before turning right without stopping.  About two seconds later,CW#7 observed a police cruiser following without lights or sirens.CW#7 estimated the cruiser’s speed at approximately 70 km/h and she believed that it was following the U-Haul while maintaining a distance from it.CW#4 was walking on the sidewalk of Samuel Street between Hohner Avenue and Brubaker Street and saw the U-Haul travelling on Hohner Avenue, approach the stop sign at Samuel Street, slow slightly, and then turn right onto Samuel Street without stopping; she described the speed of the U-Haul as very fast.CW#4 then observed a police vehicle travelling along the same route as the U-Haul, but at a much slower speed, and about four to five seconds behind the U-Haul.  She observed that the police vehicle had neither its emergency lighting system nor its siren activated.CW#4 described it as being dark at the time and that snow was accumulating on the roads.TheSOestimated that he was about 50 metres behind the U-Haul when he momentarily lost sight of it on Hohner Avenue, due to a slight bend in the road.  TheSOobserved that the van’s brake lights were active and that it was gaining speed.  TheSOradioed and asked the dispatcher if there were any other units in the area to assist him, as he believed that the driver of the U-Haul was behaving unusually.This evidence is confirmed by the police communications recording wherein theSOis heard to advise, “You got anybody available in the core area … Hohner coming back toward Lancaster, or Krug, sorry.”TheSOadvised that he followed the U-Haul on Hohner Avenue, never exceeding a speed of approximately 50 km/h. While he did not see the U-Haul make the turn, he believed it to have turned onto eastbound Samuel Street as he saw skid marks in the snow which he perceived to be acceleration marks.  At no time did theSOclose the gap between himself and the U-Haul van.  When theSOgot to the stop sign at Hohner Avenue and Samuel Street, he ensured that the way was clear before he too turned onto Samuel Street.Once on Hohner Avenue, theGPSdata confirmed theSO’s initial speed as being 25 km/h, immediately after he made the turn, and then accelerating to 51 km/h at its highest.  He then began to decelerate as he approached the intersection with Samuel Street, and his speed dropped to 16 km/h at 4:45:02 p.m., when he made a right turn onto Samuel Street.CW#2 arrived at the intersection with Samuel Street where he saw the U-Haul, for a split second, approaching from his right side, and he then heard the crunch of the vehicle hitting his car on the passenger side.  The U-Haul pushed the Cruze across the road and onto the front lawn of the residence at the corner.CW#2 observed that the U-Haul had not stopped for the stop sign.CW#2 did not hear any sirens or see any emergency lighting prior to the collision, but did see a police cruiser with its emergency lighting system activated approximately 10 seconds after the collision.CW#3 was walking on the sidewalk of Samuel Street; she described it as being daylight and that snow had accumulated on the roads.  She was some two to three houses from the stop sign on Samuel Street at Krug Street when she heard a vehicle accelerating on Samuel Street heading towards the stop sign at Krug Street.  She then observed a U-Haul go through the stop sign, without slowing or stopping, and enter the intersection with Krug Street; at no time did she see the U-Haul’s brake lights come on.CW#3 observed the U-Haul collide with a maroon coloured motor vehicle travelling on Krug Street.  Approximately five seconds after the collision,CW#3 observed a police cruiser drive past her on Samuel Street; it had neither its emergency lighting system nor its siren activated.CW#5 was looking towards the intersection of Krug Street and Samuel Street when she heard the loud sound of a vehicle and then saw the U-Haul travelling toward the intersection at a fast speed.  She estimated the speed of the U-Haul, when it got to the stop sign, as being approximately 50 km/h, where it entered the intersection and struck a second vehicle.CW#5 did not hear any sirens nor see any emergency lights prior to the collision.CW#6 indicated that as he approached the intersection at Samuel and Krug Streets, he saw the stop sign but did not stop; he estimated his speed at the time as between 80 and 110 km/h, when he struck a motor vehicle on Krug Street.CW#6 observed that the police cruiser never got near his vehicle until after the collision.CW#6 then exited his vehicle and ran away.CW#1 observed that her husband was driving on Krug Street at a speed of approximately 40 km/h as they approached the intersection with Samuel Street.  She was seated in the rear passenger seat of the vehicle. She looked to her right and saw a U-Haul enter the intersection at a speed that she estimated as being about 70 to 80 km/h, making no attempt to either brake or swerve before striking their vehicle.CW#1 indicated that she did not hear any sirens, or see any emergency lighting prior to the collision, and only first saw any red flashing lights approximately 30 seconds after the collision.  Moreover, at no time did she hear any sirens.The Complainant, who was seated in the front passenger seat of the Cruze, observed the U-Haul approach from the right, just prior to colliding with their vehicle. The Complainant saw no police emergency lighting prior to the collision.  She sustained a fractured pelvis as a result of the collision.While theSOwas driving on Samuel Street, he observed the U-Haul collide with another vehicle at Krug Street.  He described the U-Haul as having increased the distance between itself and the police cruiser prior to the collision.  TheSOnotified the dispatcher at approximately 4:45 p.m. that there had been a motor vehicle collision; he then activated his emergency lighting system and accelerated toward the collision scene.TheSO, while still on the radio, is recorded as continuing from his previous transmission, stating, “I’ve got a U-Haul van that’s driving very irregular since it saw me … Oh, and it just 9-50! (was involved in a collision) I did not light it up (activate my emergency lighting system) … there’s a 9-50 at King and … the driver may run … driver fleeing, he went behind the townhouses, going on foot”.TheGPSdata confirms that once on Samuel Street, theSOaccelerated to 33 km/h at 4:45:06 p.m., then decelerated almost immediately to 28 and then to 11 km/h at 4:45:21 p.m.  At 4:45:31, he briefly accelerated to 16 km/h, after the collision had already occurred, and his motor vehicle was then stationary at the collision scene.TheSOstated that at no time did he engage the U-Haul in a pursuit, nor did he intend to do so, his sole intention being to follow the U-Haul in order to conduct a traffic stop.While it is clear on all of the evidence thatCW#6 was aware of theSO’s interest in him, and that the police may have wished to conduct a traffic stop ofCW#6 and his U-Haul van, there is no dispute, either between the civilian witnesses,CW#6, theSO, or theGPSdata, that theSOat no time engagedCW#6 in a police pursuit.  WhileCW#6, anticipating that theSOwished to stop him, steeply accelerated and ran several stop signs, theSO’s vehicle never exceeded 51 km/h and, at no time prior to the collision, did he either activate his emergency equipment, nor did he attempt to stop the U-Haul being operated byCW#6.As such, while the presence of theSOmay have been the impetus forCW#6’s subsequent erratic driving, it is clear that the collision betweenCW#6 and the Chevrolet Cruze driven byCW#2 is attributable to the poor driving ofCW#6 alone.  Thus, it is further manifest that there is no causal connection between the driving of theSOand the unfortunate injuries sustained by the Complainant, whose injuries were directly caused by the driving ofCW#6.Although there is no causal connection between the collision, and the injuries sustained by the Complainant, and the driving of theSO, it is worthy of note that theSOfully complied with Ontario Regulation 266/10 of the OntarioPolice Services Act(OPSA) entitledSuspect Apprehension Pursuits, in that, within seconds of making his U-turn to followCW#6’s motor vehicle, he notified the dispatcher and requested assistance.  He then advised the dispatcher as to the driving behaviour of the U-Haul van, when, mid-sentence, the collision occurred.  It is also clear from the driving actions of theSO, wherein it is apparent that as an alternative to engaging in a pursuit he was ‘strategically following’[1]the U-Haul, (which is described in theWRPScompanion legislation to theOPSAas an acceptable alternative to a pursuit) that he obviously considered whether in order to protect public safety, the immediate need to apprehend an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle, or the need to identify the fleeing motor vehicle or an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle outweighed the risk to public safety that may result from the pursuit (s.2(3)), and determined that it did not.The final question to be determined is whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSO, in strategically followingCW#6, committed a criminal offence, specifically, whether or not his driving rose to the level of being dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249(1) of theCriminal Code.The decision of the Supreme Court of CanadaR. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, sets out the law with respect to s.249 in that it requires that “the driving be dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place” and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances”.On a review of all of the evidence, I find that there is no evidence that the driving of theSOcreated a danger to other users of the roadway or that he at any time interfered with other traffic; in fact, his rate of speed in followingCW#6 clearly took into account the snow covered roadways in that he operated his motor vehicle at all times at or below the posted speed limit (within one km/h above, at its highest), at no time did he spur on the poor driving ofCW#6 by activating his emergency lighting system or siren, and he appears to have fully complied with the provisions of theHighway Traffic Act.On this record, I find that the evidence of theSO’s driving does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute ‘a marked departure from the norm’ and, as indicated earlier, there is no evidence of a causal connection between the actions of theSOand the motor vehicle collision in which the Complainant was injured.  In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did theSOrespond to the situation in full compliance with theCriminal Code, theHighway Traffic Act, and the OntarioPolice Services Act, but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently, and with good common sense.  In conclusion, I find that the evidence before me does not satisfy me that I have reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed here by theSOand, as such, I find that there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.Date:	November 5, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=112
,Ontario Provincial Police,Chatham-Kent,Ontario,A CT scan was ordered and the following injuries were discovered n\nA sternal fracture with retrosternal hematoma;\nFractures to the second third and fifth ribs on the left side and\nA non-displaced L1 transverse fracture nonsurgical,"The driver of the pick-up truck called for a tow truck, and when it arrived at 12:54 p.m.,WO#3 returned to assist by placing his marked police sport utility vehicle (SUV) on the shoulder of the highway, with his emergency lighting system activated, in order to encourage traffic to move over from the curb lane, to one of the two other lanes of traffic, thereby allowing the tow truck driver to safely remove the vehicle from the ditch without endangering either himself or other passing traffic.The Subject Officer (SO) also attended the scene and parked his unmarked police vehicle some 200 to 300 metres westbound of the point where the tow truck was attempting to extract the truck from the ditch.[2]TheSOalso parked on the right shoulder of the highway with his emergency lighting system activated.At approximately 1:52 p.m., civilian witness (CW) #6 was driving eastbound on the 401 Highway and observed the emergency vehicles parked near the mile marker 54.  The dash cam video fromCW#6’s vehicle confirmed that theSO’s Dodge Charger police vehicle was parked on the right shoulder of the eastbound lanes at the time thatCW#6 passed his location, and that theSOhad his emergency lighting equipment, both front and back, activated.Additionally,WO#3 indicated that both he and theSOhad deployed flares on the roadway (four each) behind theirOPPvehicles in order to divert traffic out of the slow lane, for purposes of traffic safety.CW#5 was operating her motor vehicle eastbound on Highway 401 and observed theSO’s unmarked cruiser parked on the right shoulder of the highway with its emergency lighting activated.CW#5 correctly assumed that the purpose of theOPPvehicle being there was to get traffic to move out of the curb lane.CW#5 was driving behind a Volkswagon (VW) Touareg, which she then saw veer from the centre lane directly into the back of theOPPcruiser.CW#5 pulled over and the driver of theVWTouareg indicated to her, “I got something in my eye.”CW#2 was driving aVWTouareg in the eastbound lanes of the 401 Highway from Windsor to London with four passengers at approximately 2:50 p.m.  When he was about 20 kilometres from the ONroute Service Centre at Tilbury, he got an eyelash stuck in his right eye, which was painful, and he attempted to clear it.  He moved from the centre lane to the curb lane.CW#2 observed a vehicle ahead parked off to the right hand side of the 401 and saw that its emergency lighting system was activated.  While trying to get the eyelash out of his eye, he closed his eyes and rubbed them.  He then veered to the right and struck the Dodge Charger.Three of the passengers inCW#2’s vehicle confirmed that they heardCW#2 say that he was rubbing his eyes and did not see the car parked beside the road.CW#2 also told them that thereafter, as he was rubbing his eyes, he drove into the back of theOPPDodge Charger.At approximately 2:50 p.m.,WO#3 heard theSObroadcast, “I’ve been hit.”WO#3 immediately went to theSO’s aid and used his police vehicle to block the curb and centre lanes of traffic in order to ensure the safety of theSOand the five occupants of theVWTouareg.The conclusion drawn by the collision reconstruction report, authored byWO#2, confirmed that the physical evidence at the collision scene was consistent with theSOhaving been parked on the right shoulder of the highway at the time thatCW#2’s vehicle exited the highway, rear ending him at high speed.The occupants of theVWTouareg, as well as theSO, were taken to the hospital.  Three of the passengers from theVWTouareg were confirmed to have sustained serious injuries, including rib fractures, sternum fractures, fractures of the vertebra, and trauma to the bowel.  Many of these injuries were consistent with the fact that they were involved in a high speed collision while wearing their seatbelts.Section 159 (2) of theHighway Traffic Actrequires the driver of a motor vehicle  approaching a stopped emergency vehicle with its emergency lighting activated on a highway to both slow and proceed with caution, while subsection (3) requires:159 (3) Upon approaching an emergency vehicle with its lamp producing intermittent flashes of red light or red and blue light or a tow truck with its lamp producing intermittent flashes of amber light that is stopped on a highway with two or more lanes of traffic on the same side of the highway as the side on which the emergency vehicle or tow truck is stopped, the driver of a vehicle travelling in the same lane that the emergency vehicles or tow truck is stopped in or in a lane that is adjacent to the emergency vehicle or tow truck, in addition to slowing down and proceeding with caution as required by subsection (2), shall move into another lane if the movement can be made safely.Based on section 159 of theHighway Traffic Act, clearlyCW#2 was in contravention of these provisions when he failed to slow, proceed with caution, and move over when approaching both the emergency vehicles and the tow trucks.Had the vehicle parked on the shoulder not been an emergency vehicle, however, and only a civilian vehicle experiencing an emergency or a vehicle break down, and thus without any emergency lighting system,CW#2 would nonetheless have been at fault.Had a police vehicle with its emergency lighting system activated been actually parked in the live lanes of traffic, as, ironically,WO#3 purposefully decided to do after the collision involving theSO’s police vehicle, andCW#2 had run into that police vehicle,CW#2 would still have been at fault.While I find that theSOwas in no way responsible for the collision between his police vehicle and the vehicle driven byCW#2, and he shares no liability for the consequences of the collision, I will still review any criminal offences potentially relevant on these facts, however remote, if only to ensure that the record is complete.The only criminal charge open for consideration on these facts would be one of criminal negligence causing bodily harm contrary to s.221 of theCriminal Code.  There is no dispute that the serious injuries sustained by the three occupants of theVWTouareg were not directly attributable to the actions of theSO, the only question being whether or not theSOfailed in his duty when he parked his police vehicle on the shoulder of the 401 Highway.  Specifically, the question to be posed is whether theSOomitted to do anything that it was his duty to do and, in failing to do so, showed a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of any motorists, or passengers in motor vehicles, travelling on that portion of the highway (s.219 of theCriminal Code:  definition of criminal negligence).There are numerous decisions of the higher courts defining the requirements to prove an offence of criminal negligence; while most relate to offences involving driving, the courts have made it clear that the same principles apply to other behaviour as well.  In order to find reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted the offence of criminal negligence causing bodily harm, one must first have reasonable grounds to believe that he had a duty toward the public which he omitted to carry out, and that omission, pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. J.F.(2008), 3 S.C.R. 215, represented ‘amarked and substantial departurefrom the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in circumstances’ where theSO‘either recognized and ran an obvious and serious risk to the life’ or lives of members of the public ‘or, alternatively, gave no thought to that risk’.  The courts have also made clear that the risk of bodily harm must have been foreseeable to theSO(R. v. Shilon(2006), 240 C.C.C. (3d) 401 Ont. C.A.).While there may be a general duty imposed on police not to pose a risk to the lives or safety of members of the public, I fully accept in these circumstances, that the actions of theSO, in stopping his police vehicle on the paved shoulder of the highway, with his emergency lighting system activated, in order to alert the public to proceed with caution and to move over from the curb lane in order to give the two tow truck drivers space to safely extract the pick-up truck from the ditch, were expressly for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the public, specifically any passing motorists or their passengers, as well as of the tow truck drivers.With respect to the requirement that the risk of bodily harm must have been foreseeable to theSO, I further unequivocally accept that it would not have been foreseeable in good lighting and weather conditions, in the middle of the day, with theSO’s motor vehicle being highly visible, that a motorist would get something in his eye[3], exit the highway, and smash into theSO’s cruiser.Finally, criminal negligence, in and of itself, is not a criminal offence.  It only becomes an offence if it leads to death or bodily harm.  While I have found thatCW#2 was solely responsible for the collision which led to the serious injuries sustained by three of his passengers, I can find no causal connection between the actions of theSOand either the collision itself or the resulting injuries.In all of these circumstances, I cannot find reasonable grounds to believe that theSO’s actions satisfy any of the elements required in order to pursue a charge under s.221 of theCriminal Codein that he neither omitted to carry out any duty to act,  nor did his actions amount to a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in his circumstances, nor did he show a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of members of the public, and the subsequent injuries to the three passengers in theVWTouareg were totally unforeseeable in the circumstances.  On all of the evidence, it appears that the tragic injuries suffered by the three passengers in theVWTouareg were as a result of the driving ofCW#2 alone, and there is no causal connection between the actions of theSOand subsequent serious injuries sustained.  On this record, I can find no basis for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.Date:	October 30, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=135
,Ontario Provincial Police,Cornwall,Ontario,” The pathologist concluded that “death is attributed to gunshot wounds to the right shoulder and right side of the back,"At 11:28 a.m., the 43-year-old Complainant was pronounced dead at the scene.   A subsequent post-mortem examination revealed that the Complainant had been shot five times by theSOand had died as a result of three of those gunshot wounds, which had caused significant vascular damage which proved to be fatal.An investigation was immediately launched bySIUinvestigators.  The objective of the investigation was to determine what happened in the intervening 105 seconds between the Complainant’s entry into the detachment and the shooting of the Complainant, and to collect evidence to establish whether the use of lethal force causing the death of the Complainant was justified under the law, or if criminal charges were warranted against the police officer who caused that death.During the course of this investigation, nine civilian witnesses were interviewed, as well as 11 police witnesses, with an additional 18 potential police witnesses providing their memorandum book notes to theSIUinvestigators for review.  TheSOalso made himself available to be interviewed and voluntarily provided aDNAsample to theSIUin order that it could be analyzed and compared toDNAlocated on various items, including hisCEW, firearm, and police radio, all of which were located at the scene of the shooting of the Complainant and seized by investigators.  Of these 39 potential witnesses, including the subject officer, however, only four were actually present during the events leading up to the death of the Complainant, that beingWO#6, theSO,CW#4, a family friend of the Complainant’s, andCW#11, the Complainant’s father.[5]The investigation, fortunately, was critically aided by the availability ofCCTVfootage of the events which unfolded from the time that the Complainant arrived at the Morrisburg Detachment until he was shot in front of that same building, less than two minutes after his entering the building.SIUinvestigators were also aided by the police communications recordings, the various reports of analyses performed on various exhibits by theCFS, the post-mortem report, and the download data from theCEWs in the possession of theSOandWO#6 at the time.  While the video from the exterior of the building, although clear, only captured a portion of the interaction between the two police officers and the Complainant, and the video from the interior of the building looking out onto the incident was somewhat hampered because of the glare from the sun, the video, combined with the eyewitness evidence which was not in dispute, was able to provide an accurate timeline of the unfolding of events, a summary of which follows.Unfortunately, while there were three persons present who were in a position to provide relatively fulsome accounts of the incident leading up to, and including, the shooting of the Complainant, neither the evidence of the two police officers, who were obviously involved in what can only be described as a high-adrenaline, dynamic, and fluid situation, nor that of the one civilian witness,CW#4, fully accorded with the video evidence.  As such, except where there is no dispute as to the evidence, I have relied primarily upon the physical evidence to form my opinion, the eyewitness evidence appearing, for whatever reason, to be somewhat confused and/or inaccurate.At the time of his death, the Complainant was serving a conditional sentence order which required him to remain in his home at all times, except pursuant to those exceptions as set out by the court; he was also on a bail release requiring him to report to the MorrisburgOPPdetachment every Saturday between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.When the Complainant attended the MorrisburgOPPdetachment for his required Saturday reporting, he would often have to use the direct line telephone at the front of the building to alert theOPPcommunications centre that he was there.[6]A police officer would then be dispatched to the detachment to allow the Complainant to enter and sign the log book, confirming that he had complied with the reporting condition of his bail. The Complainant would then be free to return home.On December 20, 2017, theOPPhad received a complaint wherein it was alleged by a civilian reportee that the Complainant was in his home on that date when he spotted someone on his property.  A sales representative for an agricultural feed company, who was distributing flyers in the area, had apparently observed livestock on the Complainant’s property, as a result of which she left some sales material in the Complainant’s mailbox.  When the Complainant observed this sales representative’s motor vehicle, which was unknown to him, at the end of his driveway, he ran out of his house armed with a small knife and he confronted the sales representative, who then quickly drove away and called the police.  The sales representative later told theOPPthat the Complainant had held a knife to her throat and threatened her.As a result, theOPPinitially established a plan to arrest the Complainant when he attended his Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting that same evening, but a cursory surveillance of the parking lot where the meeting was to be held revealed that his vehicle was not present.  After contemplating the situation, theOPPthen decided that the Complainant could be arrested when he attended the MorrisburgOPPdetachment on the following Saturday, to sign in pursuant to his court ordered conditions.On Saturday, December 23, 2017,CW#4, a family friend, had agreed to drive the Complainant and his father to theOPPdetachment to allow the Complainant to sign in.  On that date,CW#4 drove the Complainant and his father to the MorrisburgOPPdetachment where, at 10:47 a.m. according to the timer on the exterior north side surveillance camera at theOPPdetachment, the Complainant used the direct line telephone mounted outside the detachment to report that he was present to sign in.  The Complainant was told that police officers would be sent to meet him.  The Complainant, his father, andCW#4, then left the police detachment to carry out some last-minute Christmas shopping.In an effort to arrest the Complainant for the new charges and the breach of his statutory release and bail conditions, it had been agreed that theSOandWO#6 would remain in the Morrisburg area in order to be available to arrest the Complainant when he attended at the detachment to sign in.As a result of the call from the Complainant on the detachment telephone, theSOandWO#6 returned to the detachment and looked for the Complainant, in order to place him under arrest.  Shortly thereafter,CW#4 drove the Complainant and his father back into the detachment parking lot and the Complainant exited the vehicle.  The Complainant was greeted at the main doors of the building and was escorted into theOPPoffice by theSOandWO#6.Once inside theOPPoffice, theSOadvised the Complainant that he was going to be arrested.  The Complainant immediately indicated he was aware of the reason for his arrest, but denied that he was at fault.  The Complainant then stated that he had to tell his father that he was being arrested, and he turned and started to walk out of the building.As the Complainant reached the outer door of the building, theSO, apparently believing that the Complainant was going to flee, grabbed onto the Complainant’s arm and shoulder to prevent him from doing so.  A struggle immediately ensued between the Complainant and the two police officers, and all three parties, still struggling, moved out of the building.During the continuing struggle, theSOhad his left arm around the Complainant’s upper chest area and the Complainant bit theSOon the arm, resulting in theSOpunching the Complainant three or four times, in order to get him to release his hold on theSO, following which the Complainant went to the ground with theSOon top of him.  WhileWO#6 and theSOwere attempting to gain control of the Complainant’s arms, at some point, theSOwas struck in the head with an object, which theSObelieved to have been his police radio, which had been attached to his vest, causing a laceration to his forehead.  TheSOthen took out hisCEWand fired a cartridge into the Complainant’s chest.  The deployment did not have the desired effect, however, and the struggle continued with the Complainant managing to take control of theSO’sCEW.TheSOthen backed up, while simultaneously being pushed away, from the Complainant and he took out his firearm, as the Complainant sat up with theCEWin his right hand.  The Complainant then reached forward with theCEW, toward theSO, and with his left hand, he grabbed at theSO’s firearm.  TheSOwas able to pull the firearm away, following which he discharged his firearm several times, with the Complainant sustaining five gunshot wounds.Once the Complainant was disabled,WO#6 and theSOperformedCPRon him, until otherOPPofficers arrived and took over.  AnAEDwas also attached to the Complainant, and, when paramedics arrived, contact was established with the base hospital.  Despite the life-saving efforts performed, the Complainant was pronounced dead shortly thereafter.TheCCTVvideo from the detachment confirms this sequence of events, although the glare on the interior camera makes some of the detail less clear than would be optimal.  Some of the less obvious detail was garnered from the statement provided by the civilian witness,CW#4, who was interviewed bySIUinvestigators the day after the shooting, when his memory was still fresh and there was no opportunity for him have possibly been influenced by others.[7]As indicated earlier, four persons were present during the shooting of the Complainant, in addition to the Complainant himself.CW#4, a friend of the Complainant’s family, was seated in the motor vehicle in which the Complainant had arrived at the detachment, and observed the entire interaction between the two police officers and the Complainant after they spilled out of the detachment in a struggle.CW#4 was initially interviewed on December 24, 2017, one day after the shooting of the Complainant.  In that initial interview,CW#4 provided a version of events which was quite consistent with theCCTVrecording, the physical evidence, and the sequence of events as set out above.In the December 24, 2017 interview,CW#4 described theSOand the Complainant exiting the detachment within a minute or two of the Complainant entering the building to sign in; this is confirmed by theCCTVfootage.  He observed the Complainant walking quickly with the two police officers following behind and it appeared toCW#4 that the Complainant should not be leaving the building.CW#4 observed theSOput his hand on the Complainant’s arm possibly to slow him down.CW#4 then described the Complainant and the two police officers bursting through the north doors of the detachment, “all in a bear hug,” following which they fell to the ground.  He described the physical interaction between the two officers and the Complainant as a very serious and violent wrestling match.CW#4 described the Complainant down on the ground, on his stomach, with theSOon top of him attempting to hold him down, whileWO#6 was kneeling near his shoulder attempting to restrain the Complainant.CW#4 observed the Complainant use his right arm to pushWO#6’s face, chest, or upper body, away on more than one occasion, causing her to slide backwards on the snow-covered ground.  On each occasion,WO#6 crawled quickly back into the struggle and it appeared toCW#4 that she was either trying to hold the Complainant’s arms, or to handcuff him.CW#4 described the Complainant as then struggling to get up and away from the two police officers, whereupon theSOdelivered two or three punches between the Complainant’s shoulder blades, using the bottom of his fist.The Complainant then rolled onto his left side, causing theSOto lose his grip on the Complainant.CW#4 then described seeing a glimpse of some type of flash or something shiny in the area of the Complainant’s chest, which I take to refer to the first deployment of theSO’sCEW, following which the Complainant rolled onto his left side with theSOremaining positioned on the Complainant’s waist or hips.  Again, all of this evidence is very consistent with, and largely confirmed by, theCCTVvideo.Additionally, theCEWdata confirms that theSOdeployed the first cartridge in hisCEWat 11:11:42 a.m., for a cycle of five seconds, and that the second cartridge was deployed at 1111:52 a.m., for an additional five second cycle.  While the clock on theCEWdata, unfortunately, is not calibrated to the clock on the video and the communications recordings, which appear to be in sync, it does give us a timeframe in which the twoCEWcartridges were discharged, that being that the second was discharged ten seconds after the first.  While the clocks are off, a counting down of ten seconds from when it appears on the video that theSOdischarged hisCEWappears to confirm that at the time of the deployment of the second cartridge, theCEWwas no longer in the possession of theSO, but was in the hands of the Complainant.This evidence is further confirmed by the post-mortem examination, wherein twoCEWprobes were found with the Complainant’s body, with one caught on the inner lining on the right side chest of his jacket, and the other was found loose in the area of his lower leg.  Neither probe was in contact with the Complainant’s skin, which presumably accounts for the fact that theCEWdeployment appeared to have no effect on the Complainant.  Additionally,CEWwiring was found entangling the Complainant’s body.An examination of the scene revealed theCEWitself lying in the snow with the wires still attached, and it was retrieved and secured bySIUforensic investigators.[8]TheCCTVfootage also reveals that seconds later,WO#6 is seen to stand up quickly and remove aCEWprobe and wire from inside her sleeve, which appears in the circumstances consistent with the Complainant having deployed the second cartridge in theCEW, after it came into his possession.CW#4 described theSOthen appearing to begin to take control of the Complainant, and reaching back with his right hand, perhaps to take out his handcuffs, whenCW#4 heard a gunshot.  He further described the Complainant as leaning on the ground, on his left elbow, and in the process of getting up, when the shot was fired, while theSOwas still on the ground with his back towardCW#4, withWO#6 to the right of the Complainant.CW#4 was very clear in his initial statement that he could not discern at that time who had fired the gunshot, as he did not see any weapon and all three parties were in a cluster on the ground.  [The exterior video establishes that he cannot have heard a gunshot at this time and I conclude that his perception was mistaken as the video shows that the gun was not discharged when all three parties were initially in a struggle on the ground.]Within one to two seconds after hearing [what he perceived as] the first gunshot,CW#4 observed the Complainant squirm out from underneath theSOand begin to stand up, causing theSOto lose his positioning; theSOwas still down on one knee at the time.  As the Complainant and theSOrose halfway to standing,CW#4 heard a second gunshot.TheSOand the Complainant continued to struggle and theSOwas observed byCW#4 attempting to restrain the Complainant, whileWO#6 was approximately six feet away, but was moving toward the Complainant.Within four seconds of the second gunshot,CW#4 described what he believed to have been a third gunshot, but he was uncertain.  He described the Complainant and theSOas still being close together, with no space between them, when that possible third shot was fired.CW#4, in his interview withSIUinvestigators, again confirmed that he did not see a weapon, nor did the actions of any of the three involved parties suggest to him that any one of the three was responsible for the firing of the weapon.CW#4 advised that the Complainant and theSO, while still physically engaged in a struggle, then crossed over to the east wall of the alcove outside of the police detachment, whereWO#6 joined in the struggle with herCEWin hand;CW#4 also described seeing theSO’s radio microphone dangling at his knees.Using his right arm, the Complainant then pushed theSOinto the east brick wall causing theSO, with his back against the wall, to lose his footing and go down to at least his knees.  This is clearly seen in theCCTVvideo, which confirms as accurate this version of events as initially provided byCW#4.CW#4 indicated that he believed that he then heard a fourth gunshot and described the Complainant and theSOas being close together at the time, with no gap between them.CW#4 still saw no firearm.CW#4 then observedWO#6 walk toward the building doors and turn to her left, aiming herCEWat the Complainant, and she remained in that position for the majority of the interaction with the Complainant; this is also clearly seen on the video and confirmsCW#4’s initial version of events.CW#4 then described the Complainant moving away from the building doors, by some ten to 12 feet, where he fell forward to his knees in front of theSO.CW#4 indicated that it did not appear to him that the Complainant was surrendering.  At that point,CW#4 heard a fifth gunshot, following which the Complainant fell fully to the ground.  At the time of the final gunshot,CW#4 described theSOas being to the right of the Complainant’s right shoulder, between the brick wall and the Complainant, and either within two to three feet, or in actual physical contact, with the Complainant.CW#4 could not recall if theSOwas upright, or on the ground with the Complainant possibly against theSO’s legs, when the fifth gunshot was fired, or thereafter.CW#4 described theSOas then extending his right arm, with his pistol in hand, and discharging three additional gunshots.CW#4 described theSO’s firearm as being fairly close to, but not touching, the Complainant at that time, and he reiterated that theSOmight not have been standing upright, asCW#4 observed that the pistol was not pointed straight downward at the Complainant, but was instead pointed diagonally across the Complainant’s body and downward.CW#4 further indicated that he believed that the Complainant and theSOwere still in physical contact at that time, but were no longer in a “bear hug,” nor were they struggling.CW#4 described the Complainant as being hit by these last three gunshots, as he saw the Complainant’s jacket “tuffed up” with each shot, as they made contact with his mid-back area.  He described the gunshots as being fired from the Complainant’s right shoulder, diagonally, toward his left hip, and striking the Complainant to the left of his spine, near the left hip[9]; he further described the three gunshots wounds as being in close proximity to each other and that the three gunshots were all discharged within one and one half seconds of each other, with a slightly greater pause between the first gunshot and the next two gunshots.CW#4 described hearing six to eight gunshots in total, but only actually seeing the last three shots fired by theSO.  During the interaction observed byCW#4, including the points in time when he heard the discharge of these six to eight gunshots,CW#4, during his initial interview withSIUinvestigators, described the Complainant and theSOas being continuously engaged in a struggle, and that they were always either in actual physical contact, or almost touching.  He further described the Complainant as at no time being compliant.This initial version of events, as provided byCW#4 within a day of the shooting, is consistent both with the video evidence, as well as the evidence of the location of the wounds as documented during the post-mortem examination, and the physical evidence located at the scene, with the only exception being that there were in fact only five gunshots discharged in total, and not the six to eight as indicated byCW#4.  It is unclear ifCW#4 possibly confused the two discharges of theCEWas also being gunfire, or if he is simply mistaken in his counting of the shots in what was obviously a very traumatic, fast-moving, and shocking incident.CW#4 indicated that after the incident, he told theSOthat he sawWO#6 with aCEWin her hand, to which theSOresponded, “I discharged one into his chest”, whichCW#4 understood to refer to theSOdischarging hisCEWat the Complainant’s chest.CW#4 described theSOas being quiet after the shooting, and he observed him to have a cut above his left eye and blood dripping down his nose, an injury to his left forearm that looked like a bite, and he noticed that theSO’s right hand was fairly swollen.  TheSOwas also observed to have mud or dirt on his right knee and some blood on his left pant leg, down toward his boots.This evidence is confirmed both by the photos of theSO’s injuries, as well as the observations of the paramedics and police witnesses at the scene, who described theSOas having a cut across his forehead and bleeding from the head, a bite mark on his left forearm, withWO#6, specifically, describing theSOas appearing to be in shock after the shooting.Immediately following the shooting of the Complainant,CW#4 was heard to make comments to the effect that the Complainant’s temperament had finally caught up with him, that he was not surprised that this had happened, due to the way that the Complainant was, and that he had seen a gun and thought that anOPPofficer had been shot.On January 16, 2018,CW#4 provided a second statement toSIUinvestigators, wherein he was asked to demonstrate some of the actions of the Complainant and the two police officers that he had observed and described in his previous interview.  On that occasion, less than three weeks after the shooting,CW#4’s version of events was materially consistent with his previous statement.On March 13, 2018, however,CW#4 sent an email to the leadSIUinvestigator in which he provided a version of events which was now significantly different, and inconsistent with, his previous two statements.  In this final version of events,CW#4, despite his earlier statements, described theSOas virtually ‘executing’ the Complainant.  In this final version,CW#4 described theSOas being fully on his feet and separated from the Complainant when he shot the Complainant three times in the back.  This version of events is not only inconsistent withCW#4’s two earlier statements, but is contradicted by theCCTVvideo of the incident and totally inconsistent with the physical evidence, particularly the bullet track as described in the Post Mortem Report.  On this basis, while the statement provided byCW#4 very shortly after the shooting, and without the opportunity for memories to fade or be influenced by intervening acts, is confirmed by the physical evidence, as well as being consistent with the video evidence, and the later version of events is inconsistent with the video and the location and trajectory of the Complainant’s wounds, I accept the accuracy ofCW#4’s first version of events, while rejecting the version outlined in his email of March 13, some two and one half months after the event.Both theSOandWO#6, unfortunately, were unable to accurately recall the exact sequence of events, nor how they occurred.  I have not assigned any motive on their part to obfuscate the facts, from their inability to accurately recall events, but rather find that this is an unfortunate result of the entire incident lasting no more than 105 seconds from the time that the Complainant entered the detachment, until the final shot was fired, with the discharges from the firearm taking significantly less time, and no more than a few seconds[11], and of both officers, due to their being directly involved in what cannot be described as anything other than a very violent, fast moving, adrenaline-pumping, and frightening situation, with both officers describing a fear both for their own lives and the lives of each other, likely suffering some shock and trauma as a result of the incident and being unfortunately unable to accurately recall the details of the incident.I find this to be especially so because some of the details omitted by theSO, in his statement toSIUinvestigators, were facts which supported his decision to discharge his firearm.  In particular, I note that theSO, at no time in his statement, mentioned that the Complainant was reaching for theSO’s firearm just prior to theSOdischarging the first shot at the Complainant, which is seen on theCCTVvideo and which fully supports theSO’s position that he felt that his life was in danger and that he had to act quickly and accordingly.Furthermore, while theSOdid not include all of the details in hisSIUinterview, I note that in utterances made to a paramedic,CW#5, immediately after the incident, when theSO’s memory was still fresh, he was able to give a fuller account of what had occurred.  In those utterances, theSOrecounted how the Complainant had come to theOPPdetachment to sign in, at which point he was to have been arrested for an outstanding charge.  TheSOexplained that when he andWO#6 informed the Complainant that he was being arrested, the Complainant turned around and started heading out of the detachment, at which point theSOfollowed and stopped the Complainant at the doors, and the Complainant began fighting with the two officers.TheSOfurther recounted that the Complainant was able to grab theSO’s radio and hit him above the eye, causing a laceration[12], and that the Complainant was then able to get a hold of theSO’sCEW; with both police officers and the Complainant then receiving a shock when theCEWwent off, because all of them were involved in a struggle at the time.  TheSOwent on to tell the paramedics that the Complainant had bitten him on the arm, following which theSOhad punched the Complainant to get him to stop, and that the Complainant had reached for a knife which theSOhad in his protective vest, and tried to grab it.  TheSOfurther recounted that during the fight, he discharged his firearm three times.A second paramedic,CW#6, also recalled theSOmentioning that the Complainant grabbed at theSO’s radio, hisCEW, his gun, and a knife that he had stored on the front of his vest.CW#6 recalled theSOindicating that while he was trying to protect the knife from the Complainant, the Complainant took hold of hisCEWand was able to discharge it, following which the Complainant again reached for theSO’s firearm.  According to theSO, as he tried to protect his firearm from the Complainant, he was struck in the head with what he believed was his radio, and he discharged his firearm.I note that theSO, although missing some of these very relevant and material details in hisSIUstatement, was heard to recount these facts, including the twice grabbing at his firearm by the Complainant, to several witnesses immediately following the shooting.  I can only surmise that either as a result of shock, or the passage of time, theSOhad blocked out some of these details in the intervening seven months between the time of the incident and his interview[13].  As such, while I have discounted theSO’s statement to investigators as unreliable in some aspects, I have chosen instead to rely on the details provided by theSOimmediately after the shooting, when his memories were fresh and not influenced by the passage of time or other matters.On the basis of this very compelling evidence, then, I accept that: theSOpursued the Complainant as the Complainant attempted to leave the police detachment after having been placed under arrest by the two police officers; that theSOhad reasonable grounds to apprehend the Complainant on charges of assault with a weapon and threatening; that once theSOreached out in order to take control of the Complainant, and prevent him from leaving, the Complainant initially assaulted theSO, with the police radio, and then bit him on the forearm; that theSOfirst resorted to his physical strength to try and restrain the Complainant, by delivering several punches to the Complainant, which appeared to have no effect, and that when the Complainant continued to fight theSO, theSOdeployed hisCEW, which was ineffective in that it did not stop the Complainant from further assaulting theSO; that the Complainant had theSO’sCEWin his hand, and was reaching for theSO’s firearm, while theSO, having been pushed against, and having his back to, the wall, was unable to back away from the Complainant or to gain control over him; and that as the Complainant continued to struggle with theSO, while simultaneously reaching for theSO’s use of force options, and refusing to either stop struggling or to drop theCEW, theSOdischarged his firearm, striking the Complainant and causing his death.Before proceeding to my decision, I wish to address the post-mortem report in which the forensic pathologist noted that the three gunshots from theSO’s firearm, which proved to be fatal, all entered from the back of the Complainant.  While at first blush this may raise some question with respect to the justification of the shooting of the Complainant, it is without dispute, based on the video evidence, that the Complainant and theSOwere involved in a struggle at the time that theSOdischarged his firearm, and that the actions and position of the Complainant left theSOwith few choices.It is further clear that while the Complainant was reaching for theSO’s use of force options[14], and was in very close proximity, if not in direct physical contact with, theSO, theSOwould have had very limited choices but to discharge his firearm with his arm reaching over the back of the Complainant; had he attempted to insert his firearm between himself and the Complainant, it is very likely that he would have risked shooting himself, or having the Complainant disarm him of his firearm.  On this evidence, which is supported by theCCTVvideos, there appears to be very limited time and space between theSOand the Complainant, during the struggle and the assault upon theSO, for theSOto be able to discharge his firearm to the front of the Complainant while the Complainant was actively attacking theSO.[15]The Law and AnalysisThe question that remains to be answered, then, on the facts as I have found them, is whether or not theSOwas justified in using lethal force against the Complainant, or whether the discharging of his firearm at the Complainant was an excessive use of force in these circumstances and provides reasonable grounds for the laying of criminal charges against theSOfor causing the death of the Complainant.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Further, pursuant to subsection 3:(3)  … a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.As such, in order for theSOto qualify for protection from prosecution under section 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.  Furthermore, pursuant to subsection 3, since death was caused, it must also be established that theSOdischarged his firearm believing, on reasonable grounds, that it was necessary in order to preserve himself, or others, from death or grievous bodily harm.Turning first to the lawfulness of the attempted apprehension of the Complainant, it is evident from the 911 call relating to the December 20 incident, that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant had assaulted that party with a knife and that there were therefore reasonable grounds to believe that he had committed the offences of both threatening and assault with a weapon, contrary to ss. 264.1 and 266 of theCriminal Code, respectively.  As such, I am satisfied that the pursuit and attempted arrest of the Complainant were legally justified in the circumstances.With respect to the other requirements pursuant to s.25(1) and (3), I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]The court describes the test required under s.25 as follows:Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances. That is not the end of the matter. Section 25(3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force, i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily harm. The officer's belief must be objectively reasonable. This means that the use of force under s. 25(3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis (Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).The decision of Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice inChartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada above, sets out other relevant provisions of theCriminal Codeto be considered, as follows:27. 	Use of force to prevent commission of offence - Everyone is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary(a)	to prevent the commission of an offence(i) for which, if it were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and(ii) that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone, or(b)	to prevent anything being done that, on reasonable grounds, he believes would, if it were done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).This Section, therefore, authorizes the use of force to prevent the commission of certain offenses. Everyone"" would include a police officer. The force must not be more than that which is reasonably necessary. Therefore, an objective test is called for. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Scopelliti (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 held that the use of deadly force can be justified only in either cases of self-defence or in preventing the commission of a crime likely to cause immediate and serious injury.34(1) 	Self-defence against unprovoked assault - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him to defend himself.(2)	Extent of justification - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified if(a)	he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and(b)	he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.In order to rely on the defence under subsection (2) of Section 34, a police officer would have to demonstrate that he/she was unlawfully assaulted and caused death or grievous bodily harm to the assaulter in repelling the assault. The police officer must demonstrate that he or she reasonably apprehended that death or grievous bodily harm would result to him or her and that he or she, again on reasonable grounds, believed that he/she could not otherwise preserve himself/herself from death or grievous bodily harm. Again, the use of the term reasonable requires the application of an objective test.The court also sets out a number of other legal principles gleaned from the legal precedents cited, including the following:(h) 	Whichever section of theCriminal Codeis used to assess the actions of the police, the Court must consider the level of force that was necessary in light of the circumstances surrounding the event.(i) 	""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". The same applies to the use of force in making an arrest or preventing an escape. Like the driver of a vehicle facing a sudden emergency, the policeman ""cannot be held to a standard of conduct which one sitting in the calmness of a court room later might determine was the best course."" (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).(j) 	Police officers perform an essential function in sometimes difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. The police must not be unduly hampered in the performance of that duty. They must frequently act hurriedly and react to sudden emergencies. Their actions must therefore be considered in the light of the circumstances.(k) 	""It is both unreasonable and unrealistic to impose an obligation on the police to employ only the least amount of force which might successfully achieve their objective. To do so would result in unnecessary danger to themselves and others. They are justified and exempt from liability in these situations if they use no more force than is necessary, having regard to their reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers in which they find themselves"" (Levesque v. Zanibbi et al.).On the basis of the foregoing principles of law then, I must determine:(1)	Whether theSOreasonably subjectively believed that he, or others, were at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant at the time that he discharged his firearm; and,(2)	Whether that belief was objectively reasonable, or, in other words, whether his actions would be considered reasonable by an objective bystander who had all of the information available to him that theSOhad at the time that he discharged his firearm.With respect to the first of these criteria, the statement of theSOestablishes that he believed that he was at risk of death or grievous bodily harm at the time that he discharged his firearm.  He based that belief on his observations at the time that both the punches that he had inflicted on the Complainant, and the subsequent deployment of hisCEWat the Complainant, had been ineffective and had failed to either stop or even hinder the Complainant; that the Complainant had already assaulted him by biting him on the forearm and striking him in the head with his own police radio, from which he had received a laceration; that the Complainant had disarmed him of hisCEWand had it in hand; and that, if the Complainant had managed to deploy theCEWat theSO, there was a distinct possibility that the Complainant would then disable theSOallowing him access to theSO’s firearm and other use of force options, which would quickly escalate the situation and make it far more dangerous and very likely lethal.  Combined with the knowledge that the Complainant had a history of violence and unpredictable behaviour, with theSObeing aware that the Complainant had previously threatened a police officer with a machete; that the Complainant had been flagged on the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) as being violent; that he was now advancing on theSOand was reaching for his use of force option; that the Complainant refused either to stop or to drop theCEW; and, that the previous deployment of theCEWhad been ineffective, the situation appeared to leave only one option by which to effectively stop the Complainant from attacking theSO, that being theSO’s resort to his firearm.On all of the information that theSOhad in his possession at the time that he shot and killed the Complainant, I find that he, subjectively, had reasonable grounds to believe that his life, or the lives of others, was at risk from the Complainant and that his observations of the Complainant’s actions, as well as the information provided as to the Complainant’s history, would have reasonably caused theSOto believe that not only he, but alsoWO#6, was at imminent risk of being seriously injured, if not killed, by the Complainant.  Furthermore, should the Complainant be able to access theSO’s other use of force options, including his firearm, it would put other persons in the community equally at risk.In considering the reasonableness of theSO’s actions, and whether or not he considered the use of less lethal use of force options before resorting to his firearm, as confirmed byCW#4,WO#6, the video recording, the evidence located at the scene, and theCEWdownload data, it is clear that theSOhad already resorted both to physical force and to the only other less lethal use of force option (hisCEW) available to stop the Complainant, both of which had proven ineffective[16], thereby leaving only his firearm as a viable alternative.  On that basis, I find that theSO, in the brief number of seconds available to him after he had deployed hisCEW, and while the Complainant was quickly advancing upon him and continuing to assault him, appears to have considered all of his options before discharging his firearm.The law relating to the justification in using force intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm establishes that if one believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for one’s self-preservation from death or grievous bodily harm, or the preservation of others, to resort to lethal force, then the use of that force is justifiable.  Having extensively reviewed all of the evidence in this case, I find in all the circumstances that theSOreasonably believed that his life was in danger from the Complainant and thus his actions in firing upon the Complainant were justified.  I find that it would have been foolish and reckless for theSOto risk losing his life by waiting for the Complainant to either again discharge theCEW, or to disarm him of his firearm, thereby putting his own life at immediate risk of serious injury or death.  I further find that risk was not one that theSOought to have had to take when faced with this very violent and unpredictable assailant.I find, therefore, on this record, that the shots that were fired by theSO, which struck and killed the Complainant, were justified pursuant to ss.25 (1) and (3) of theCriminal Codeand that theSO, in preserving himself or others from death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant, used no more force than was necessary to affect his lawful purpose.  As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by theSO, despite the tragic loss of life, fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date:	January 11, 2019Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=196
,Ontario Provincial Police,Bonfield,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant was examined at hospital and diagnosed with fractures to the 10th and 11th ribs on the left side,"TheSOwas operating a black Chevy Tahoe with subdued markings and an emergency lighting system on the dash inside the vehicle and on the grille near the push bars.  TheSOwas en route to the accident scene at just after 5:00 p.m., travelling eastbound on Highway 17.  He had not activated either his emergency lighting system or his siren, as the call did not require them.The Complainant was operating a Buick LeSabre travelling northbound on Trout Pond Road, approaching the stop sign at its intersection with Highway 17, where the Complainant intended to make a left turn onto Highway 17 westbound to head towards North Bay.  The Complainant had two occupants in her motor vehicle.CW#2 was driving two cars behind theSO, travelling eastbound on Highway 17.  He estimated that his own speed, and that of the two cars in front of him, including the policeSUV, was a steady 95 km/h.CW#2 had followed these two vehicles for some time, and they had maintained the same formation, with all three in the curb lane.CW#2 estimated that theOPPvehicle was approximately 200 metres ahead of his own vehicle.All vehicles had their headlights activated, and all occupants were wearing their seatbelts.  The roads were lightly snow covered and had been plowed, the weather was dark or close to dark, but clear, it was not snowing and the traffic was light.  The speed limit on both Highway 17 and Trout Pond Road at this location is a posted 90 km/h.At approximately 5:15 p.m., theSOwas approaching the intersection with Trout Pond Road and pulled into the passing lane on a straight stretch of the highway to pass another motor vehicle, approximately half of a kilometre before the intersection.  While he was unaware of the speed of his vehicle, hisMPSGPS andCADdata indicated that he was travelling at just over 100 km/h for 26 seconds and at approximately 135 km/h for about eight seconds prior to entering the intersection with Trout Pond Road.The Complainant was stopped on Trout Pond Road at the stop sign at Highway 17. She recalled being stopped for a full three seconds and observing that there was no westbound traffic, but that there was traffic coming eastbound.  The Complainant observed one vehicle in the curb lane and one in the passing lane; she could only see the headlights of these vehicles, and not the actual vehicles at the time that she made her observation.  The Complainant estimated that the vehicle in the passing lane was slightly ahead of that in the curb lane, but they were very close to each other.The Complainant made a judgment call and pulled out onto Highway 17 to start her left turn; she was of the view that she had sufficient time to complete her turn before the two eastbound vehicles approached.TheSOobserved a motor vehicle stopped at the stop sign at Trout Pond Road, as he approached from a distance of roughly 200 to 300 feet.  TheSOsaw the vehicle move forward slightly and believed it was going to stop and wait for traffic to pass.  TheSOtapped his brakes.CW#2 described the Complainant’s motor vehicle as pulling out directly in front of the police vehicle, leaving theSOno time to react.The Complainant indicated that while she initially believed that she had sufficient time to safely complete her left turn, as she crossed the curb lane and entered the passing lane where theSOwas driving, she sped up as she realized that the vehicle was coming towards her faster than anticipated.  The Complainant believed that the police vehicle swerved partially into the westbound lanes, either because she had startled the driver, or to avoid striking her vehicle.  The GPS data on the Complainant’s vehicle indicated that she had accelerated to 48 km/h at the point of impact.TheSOindicated that the stopped vehicle then drove out in front of his vehicle and he initially swerved to the left (into the westbound lanes) and then to the right to try to get around the vehicle.  He braked hard to avoid a collision.  The GPS data confirmed that theSOhad slowed his vehicle to 57 km/h prior to impact.The GPS data from both vehicles indicated that theSObraked and the Complainant accelerated for approximately 3.5 seconds prior to impact.At approximately 5:15 p.m., theOPPvehicle driven by theSOcollided with the driver’s side front and rear doors of the Buick LeSabre operated by the Complainant.The Complainant sustained fractures to the tenth and eleventh ribs on her left side (or closest to the driver’s door) while theSOsustained a fracture to his left wrist.Two civilian witnesses in addition to the Complainant and theSOwere interviewed during the course of this investigation; all agree upon the facts as set out above.Pursuant to section 136 of theHighway Traffic Act(HTA), the onus is on the driver governed by a stop sign to stop his or her vehicle and:… yield the right of way to traffic in the intersection or approaching the intersection on another highway so closely that to proceed would constitute an immediate hazard and, having yielded the right of way, may proceed.As such, in this factual situation, the Complainant, who was governed by a stop sign while theSOhad the right of way, was obligated, after stopping, to yield the right of way to traffic approaching on Highway 17, and not to proceed until it was safe to do so.  While the Complainant made a judgment call believing that she had sufficient time to complete her turn, she was in error.As such, while it is clear that theHTAputs the responsibility onto the driver facing a stop sign to ensure that the way is clear before proceeding, the only question remaining to be determined is whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence, specifically, whether or not his driving rose to the level of being dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249 (1) of theCriminal Codeand did thereby cause bodily harm contrary to s.249 (3), in that he was operating his motor vehicle in excess of the posted speed limit by some 45 km/h just prior to the collision.Pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, s.249 requires that the driving be “dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place” and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances.”In applying the reasonable person test, I must consider if theSO’s driving was a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in his circumstances would observe.  As such, I must determine if his driving amounted to a marked departure from that of a police officer, who is exempt from complying with the posted speed limit, pursuant to s. 138 (13), wherein it indicates that:(13)  The speed limits prescribed under this section or any regulation or by-law passed under this section do not apply to,(b) a police department vehicle being used in the lawful performance of a police officers’ duties.As such, while theSOwas exceeding the posted speed limit of 90 km/h, he was not in contravention of theHTA, as he was both operating a police department vehicle and he was doing so in the lawful performance of his duties, that being responding to a call for police assistance involving a motor vehicle collision.In assessing the driving of theSO, I have reminded myself of the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada that I am not to hold police to an unattainable standard of perfection, as enunciated in their decision inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206.As well as their pronouncement inR. v. Roy(2012), 281 C.C.C. (3d) 433, wherein the Supreme Court of Canada held that a simple misjudgment could not reasonably support an inference of a marked departure, as follows:A fundamental point inBeattyis that dangerous driving is a serious criminal offence. It is, therefore, critically important to ensure that the fault requirement for dangerous driving has been established. Failing to do so unduly extends the reach of the criminal law and wrongly brands as criminals those who are not morally blameworthy. The distinction between ameredeparture, which may support civil liability, and themarkeddeparture required for criminal fault is a matter of degree. The trier of fact must identify how and in what way the departure from the standard goesmarkedlybeyond mere carelessness.And further:Simple carelessness, to which even the most prudent drivers may occasionally succumb, is generally not criminal. As noted earlier, Charron J., for the majority in Beatty, put it this way: ""If every departure from the civil norm is to be criminalized, regardless of the degree, we risk casting the net too widely and branding as criminals persons who are in reality not morally blameworthy"" (para. 34). The Chief Justice expressed a similar view: ""Even good drivers are occasionally subject to momentary lapses of attention. These may, depending on the circumstances, give rise to civil liability, or to a conviction for careless driving. But they generally will not rise to the level of a marked departure required for a conviction for dangerous driving"" (para. 71).I have also carefully considered the decision of our Court of Appeal inR. v. Pezzo, [1972] O.J. No. 965, that excessive speed alone does not necessarily equate with dangerous driving.  The following is an excerpt from that case, in which the Court found that the offence of dangerous driving was not made out despite the extremely high rate of speed at which the Appellant was travelling at the time:With respect to the dangerous driving there is very little evidence. The Crown gave particulars of the dangerous driving and restricted itself to excessive speed. My brother Arnup and I are of the opinion that on the scanty evidence presented it would be unsafe to maintain a conviction. The learned trial Judge said:• ""On all the evidence before me I find that you took this car, had it in your possession, stole it, were driving it. The car tipped over, on the evidence before me, after a skid mark of some 98 feet, flipped over on its back ... for another 42 feet skid mark which indicates a great deal of speed, a collision with the wall. On all the evidence before me I find you guilty of the charge of theft of a motor vehicle and dangerous driving.""With respect to the learned trial Judge we are not satisfied that the evidence clearly discloses that the appellant was driving in such a manner that the driving can be characterized as dangerous driving within the meaning of the relevant section of the Code. We would accordingly allow the appeal against conviction and direct an acquittal on the charge of dangerous driving.And the subsequent decision inR. v. M.K.M., [1998] O.J. No. 1601, that in certain circumstances, excessive speed alone may be sufficient to establish dangerous driving:Depending on the context in which it occurred, excessive speed can amount to a marked departure from the standard of care of a prudent driver. Here the context included the following: the accident occurred on a busy highway in a built up area of Mississauga, and just before the accident the appellant had been driving aggressively and engaging in ""horseplay"" on the road with her co-accused. Although their estimates of the appellant's driving speed varied, all of the independent witnesses testified that she was driving too fast. The evidence of …  all supported the trial judge's conclusion that the appellant was driving well above the speed limit and too quickly to avoid any unexpected occurrence on the highway. Indeed, Miss Black gave evidence that the appellant lost control of her car because she was driving too fast.Having fully considered the edicts from our Court of Appeal as to the factors to consider in assessing whether or not I have reasonable grounds to believe that there is sufficient evidence to make out a charge of dangerous driving in this case, I find that I do not.Taking into account that the only evidence that I have which would support a charge of dangerous driving would be that of a rate of speed which exceeded the posted speed limit, while theSOwas responding to a call for assistance, countered by the evidence that the officer was immediately aware that a motor vehicle had entered the intersection in his path, that he immediately braked and attempted evasive manoeuvres in order to avoid a collision, and that there is no evidence, other than mere speed, that theSO’s driving was anything less than compliant withHTAprovisions, I must conclude, in the absence of some evidence that theSOwas driving in a dangerous manner other than the rate of speed at which he travelled for a brief period of time, that the evidence falls far short of satisfying me that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the actions of theSOamounted to a ‘marked departure’ of the standard of care of a reasonable police officer in these circumstances.In conclusion, having considered all of the evidence, which is not disputed as between all of the civilian witnesses and theSO, while I find that the driving of theSOmay not have attained a level of perfection, I have no hesitation in finding that neither did it rise to the level of being criminal in nature.The unfortunate collision in which both drivers were injured was not as a direct result of the driving of theSO, nor is there a causal connection between the actions of theSOand the consequent injuries sustained.  As such, since I lack the necessary grounds for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	October 18, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=80
,Niagara Regional Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,Upon assessment the Complainant was found to have a mildly displaced fracture extending through the floor of the right orbit eye socket as well as the anterior and lateral walls of the right maxillary antrum sinus,"At 2:19:48 p.m., a second 911 call was received, this time fromCW#1, who reported that he had seen a suspicious male going from house to house on Classic Avenue checking doors and that the male had been seen going to the back door of a house where an elderly woman lived.At 2:22:22 p.m., officers were dispatched to the area.WO#1, who was familiar with the Complainant from a prior arrest for breaking and entering, heard the radio call and advised dispatch to hold the uniformed officers out of the area, in order that his unit could go in and observe, and possibly arrest, the Complainant in the act of breaking and entering.WO#1 then dispatched theSO, who was in plainclothes, to the area to carry out some surveillance on the Complainant.Shortly thereafter, the Complainant was arrested for breaking and entering and was transported to hospital, where he was assessed and diagnosed as having sustained a mildly displaced fracture extending through the floor of the right orbit (eye socket) and the anterior and lateral walls of the right maxillary antrum (sinus).The Complainant alleged that on December 19, 2017, he was going to visit a friend on Empress Avenue in the City of Welland.  Empress Avenue and Classic Avenue are two adjacent streets.  When the Complainant arrived, however, his friend was not at home and he walked down the street where he found two large American gold coins on the front lawn of a house on either Empress or Classic Avenues.  The Complainant advised that he picked up the coins and then called at the house to see if they belonged to the occupants.  Since there was no one home at the house, he began to walk away, when he was approached byCW#3.CW#3 asked him if he knew the homeowners, since the Complainant had just knocked on their door, and the Complainant told him about the gold coins, which he then showed toCW#3.CW#3 told him that he did not need to see the coins and left.The Complainant then walked down an alleyway between two fenced back yards where he heard voices.  The Complainant alleged that the next thing he recalled was being punched twice, in the right side of his face from behind, and falling onto the ground.  He claimed that the person who punched him was a police officer.  There were also two other police officers present, one of whom told him to stop resisting, to let go, and to give up his hands.  The Complainant advised that he was “out of it” and could not recall what he was doing, but he did not believe that he resisted.The Complainant attributed his poor memory to possibly having suffered a concussion in the week prior to his arrest, as he had passed out on several occasions and had subsequently attended hospital.After having fallen, the Complainant described the officers as being rough with him and pushing down on him, but they did not punch him once he was on the ground.The Complainant was told that he was under arrest for breaking and entering and possession of stolen property, but he did not know to which house or what property they were referring.  He was then lifted up from the ground and walked by three police officers to a police vehicle.The Complainant further alleged that when he was being placed into the rear of the cruiser, he was pushed from behind on the back of his head and smashed into the police vehicle.  The Complainant could not recall which part of his body struck the police vehicle, but he did recall that he had not resisted.  The Complainant conceded, however, that he may have been a little wobbly and that the smashing against the car may have been accidental.The Complainant indicated that once he was inside the cruiser, he at no time banged his face off of the interior of the police cruiser nor did he ever kick at the window.The Complainant was then taken to hospital, but had no memory of being triaged, although he did recall a doctor telling him that he had fractures to the bones in his cheek under his right eye.During the course of this investigation, in addition to the Complainant, seven civilian and five police witnesses were interviewed, none of whom corroborated the Complainant’s version of events, and most of whom directly contradicted his allegations.  The following is a summary of the events based on the reliable evidence obtained.WO#1 received a report from theSOthat he had observed the Complainant attempt to open patio doors on properties on Classic Avenue.WO#1 then sentWO#2 to the area to assist theSO.  TheSOthen further reported that he had observed the Complainant walk in between two houses on Classic Avenue and that he had not come out for approximately 15 minutes.WO#1 then decided to send uniformed officers into the area to attempt to flush out the Complainant.WO#1 arrived in the area himself at 3:04 p.m. and heardWO#2 announce over the radio that he had observed the Complainant run in an easterly direction from a residence on Classic Avenue.WO#1 returned to his vehicle and drove to Classic Avenue, where he sawWO#2 pointing in the direction in which the Complainant had run, that being between a number of houses that backed onto an open space.WO#1 then went into the backyard area and saw a number of people who toldWO#1 that the Complainant had run in a northeasterly direction through the backyards.WO#1 then drove along Classic Avenue where he saw the Complainant run around the corner from the backyard of a house.WO#1 stopped and exited his vehicle and ran after the Complainant, who was about 35 feet ahead of him.  He shouted loudly at the Complainant not to move.  Immediately thereafter, theSOran around the corner of the house and also chased after the Complainant.  TheSOwrapped both of his arms around the Complainant and tackled him from behind, in a football-style tackle, and then both fell to the ground.  TheSOwas not observed to strike the Complainant before he tackled him.WO#1 was unable to see which part of the Complainant’s body hit the ground first.The Complainant lay face down on the ground with theSOon his right trying to gain control of the Complainant’s right arm.  There was no fight and no punches were thrown.  Within three to four seconds,WO#1 took control of the Complainant’s left arm and he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back at 3:08 p.m.The Complainant denied to the police officers that he was in possession of any stolen property or that he had done anything wrong.Four civilian witnesses observed the Complainant down on the ground with his hands handcuffed behind his back, although unfortunately, none saw him taken to the ground.CW#6 first saw the Complainant walking along the side of one of the houses and then saw him at the bedroom/bathroom window of that house.CW#6 ran to the home ofCW#4, where she saw a plainclothes police officer exit an unmarked vehicle, and she told him that the Complainant was in the backyard.CW#6 then saw two more plainclothes police officers and a marked cruiser arrive and all of the officers ran into the backyard.  She heard the police officers yelling out, “Freeze, freeze, get down on the ground!”CW#6 then joinedCW#4 and they both saw the Complainant lying on his stomach on the ground, with two or three plainclothes police officers and a uniformed police officer standing around him.  Two of the plainclothes officers were seen to crouch down beside the Complainant for a few seconds, and then they helped him to his feet.  None of the police officers were observed to deliver any strikes or do anything inappropriate to the Complainant.  The Complainant was then walked by the two plainclothes police officers to the marked police vehicle.  Neither ofCW#6 orCW#4 observed any injuries to the Complainant.CW#7 also saw the Complainant lying face down on the grass, with his hands handcuffed behind his back, and two plainclothes police officers, with one each on either side of him.CW#7 indicated that there was no struggle between the police and the Complainant.CW#7 advised that after about five to ten minutes, a fully marked policeSUVarrived and stopped close to where the Complainant was lying on the ground and the Complainant was led to the rear of theSUVand placed into the rear seat.Similarly,CW#5 saw two men kneeling on the grassy area between two homes, with one man on each side of the Complainant.  She described the two men, who she immediately recognized as being plainclothes police officers, as holding the Complainant down and that there was no struggle.CW#5 at no time observed any police officer strike or do anything inappropriate to the Complainant, who was handcuffed with his hands behind his back.CW#5 also advised that there was no struggle as the two officers lifted the Complainant to his feet and walked him over and placed him into the rear of a marked policeSUV, but it appeared to her that the Complainant was reluctant to get inside.CW#5 advised that she had a clear and unobstructed view of the Complainant being placed into theSUVand at no time did she observe any police officer slam the Complainant into the body of the motor vehicle.After the Complainant was in the police vehicle, however,CW#5 heard banging sounds coming from theSUVand she saw it swaying from side to side.CW#5 advised that this banging went on for some five to seven seconds and she believed that the Complainant was either banging his feet or slamming his shoulder inside the vehicle.CW#7 indicated that he also had a clear view of the Complainant being placed into the policeSUVand he confirmed that the Complainant’s head was not slammed against either the roof or the top of the door as he was placed into theSUV.  Thereafter,CW#7 observed that the Complainant was alone in the vehicle when he heard four or five loud thumps and saw theSUVrocking on its suspension.CW#7 saw the Complainant’s head bounce about inside the vehicle and he assumed that the Complainant must have thrown himself around and banged into the caged area in the back of the cruiser.  It also appeared toCW#7 that the Complainant was kicking at something inside of the vehicle.CW#7 then saw a uniformed police officer open the door and briefly speak with the Complainant, but the officer did not enter the vehicle at that time. The officer then closed the door and the banging stopped.  At no time didCW#7 see any police officer strike the Complainant.WO#1 stated that when the Complainant was taken up from the ground and placed on his feet, he observed a small speck of blood under his right nostril.WO#4, the uniformed officer at the scene, indicated that he had heard over the radio that the Complainant was in custody and he attended and observed the Complainant face down on the ground at the side of a residence on Classic Avenue, withWO#1 and theSO.  He described the Complainant as being uncooperative asWO#1 tried to apply the handcuffs, but not violently resisting, andWO#4 leaned in and assisted with handcuffing the Complainant.  He did not observe eitherWO#1 or theSOdeliver any strikes to the Complainant.WO#4 then brought his cruiser around to the area where the Complainant was located and he took control of the Complainant and placed him into the rear seat without any issue.WO#4 saw no injury to the Complainant as he placed him inside the vehicle.  However, once the Complainant was inside the vehicle, he almost immediately started to bang his head on the Plexiglas partition and the side windows, following which he lay across the seat and attempted to kick out the side door window.WO#4 stated that he then radioed in to report what the Complainant had done, as it was normal practice to alert the lock-up staff that a violent prisoner was en route.  This is confirmed by the police transmissions recording, wherein a police officer is first heard to report, “Male’s hitting his head off the partition,” followed byWO#4, at 3:35:25 p.m., reporting that “A male is cracking his head off the partition, can you send (a car with a half cage) … and now he’s trying to kick out my windows.”WO#4 opened the rear door and told the Complainant to calm down and relax, which the Complainant then did.WO#4 noted that the Complainant had a little bit of dried blood on his nose, and he saw a light scratch and dried blood on the left orbital area of his face, but he had no other marks or abrasions.WO#2 observed theSOsearch the Complainant while they were still in the backyard, while the Complainant was lying on the ground.  TheSOhanded the items located in the Complainant’s pockets over toWO#2, as they were located, including a charm bracelet and a wallet.WO#2 also observed that the Complainant had a little bit of blood on his nostril.  When the Complainant was placed into the police vehicle,WO#2 indicated that he did not observe the Complainant bang any part of his body off of the vehicle as he was being placed inside, but that once inside, the Complainant immediately banged his head on the interior Plexiglas partition and then leaned back in the rear seat and kicked at the passenger window.WO#2 then returned to the residence, where he saw that one of the basement windows was open and he located a pillow case stuffed with items beside the open window.  The home owner of that residence,CW#2, was then contacted and returned to his home; he identified the wallet and charm bracelet found on the Complainant’s person, as well as the property in the pillow case, as having been stolen from his home.During the Complainant’s assessment at hospital, the following notes were made on his chart:In the triage notes:Pt (patient) states was being arrested for a breaking and entering and possession of stolen property and was “taken down” by being repeatedly punched in the face.An entry by the nursing staff reads:Pt was assaulted, states was hit by another person to face x1 today.And a third note in the nursing notes reads:Pt states he does not remember what happened to him.On all of the evidence, I find that the Complainant is not a reliable historian as to what occurred on December 19, 2017, when he was arrested.  Based on the blatant contradictions between his evidence and that of the civilian witnesses alone, in addition to the physical evidence, I find that the Complainant’s credibility has been severely damaged.  These contradictions include the following (which is not an exhaustive list):The Complainant’s explanation as to what he was doing in the area, which is directly contradicted not only by the observations ofCW#3 andCW#1, but by the property found on his person which was later identified byCW#2 as having been stolen from his home on that date;The Complainant’s assertion that he never struck his head on the Plexiglas partition or attempted to kick out the rear window of the police vehicle, which is directly contradicted by bothCW#7 andCW#5, as well as byWO#2 andWO#4, and the police transmissions communication recording; andThe Complainant’s allegation that his head was smashed into the cruiser as he entered, which is again directly contradicted byWO#2 andWO#4, as well as byCW#7 andCW#5, who both indicated that they had a clear and unobstructed view of the Complainant as he was being placed in the vehicle.On the basis of these proven misstatements in the evidence of the Complainant, I find that I am unable to accept any of his evidence other than that which is directly confirmed by other witnesses and/or physical evidence.As such, while there was only one witness to theSOtaking the Complainant to the ground, that beingWO#1, I have no difficulty in rejecting the evidence of the Complainant, who I find has little or no credibility, in favour of the evidence ofWO#1, and I reject that the Complainant was taken to the ground by being punched in the face once (as recorded by the nursing staff in his medical records), twice (as per his statement toSIUinvestigators) or repeatedly (as indicated in his triage notes), in favour of his last statement in his medical records, that he simply does not know what happened.I find further support in this conclusion in the fact that the Complainant, in his interview, described himself as being “out of it” and having a poor recollection of events, due to his possibly having sustained a concussion the week prior to his arrest.While not conclusive, I also find that it is improbable that theSOcould have punched the Complainant in the right side of his face, while the Complainant was faced away from theSOas he was running.On these facts, however, while I reject the allegation that the Complainant was punched in the face by theSOas being unreliable, the fact still remains that at some point the Complainant was injured.  Based on the reliable evidence before me, that occurred either when the Complainant was tackled to the ground and his face may have struck the ground, or alternatively, when he smashed his face into the Plexiglas partition.There is no question that the Complainant, despite his assertion to the contrary, did smash his head into the Plexiglas partition, as observed by two independent civilian witnesses,CW#7 andCW#5, to such a degree thatCW#5 heard the thuds from inside her house andCW#7 observed the policeSUVto be rocking on its suspension.  As such, with the degree of force that would have been required to cause these loud bangs and rock theSUV, it is very likely that the Complainant was injured through his own actions and at his own hand, and that the police played no part in his injury whatsoever.However, in the far less likely event that the Complainant was injured when theSOtackled him to the ground, and thereby caused his facial area to strike the grass, which I expect would have been a far lesser trauma than would be involved in smashing one’s face into the Plexiglas, the evidence does not satisfy me that this action would have amounted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances.  It is clear on all of the evidence that the Complainant was behaving suspiciously, that he had been observed by several witnesses attempting to gain entry to other persons’ homes, that he was very likely in the process of carrying out a residential break and enter, and that he was now attempting to flee from police, making it incumbent upon theSOto stop, detain, and investigate the Complainant.  As such, I accept that his action in tackling the Complainant to the ground, in order to prevent his escape, was both necessary and justified, and involved the minimal amount of force required to achieve that purpose.In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.  On these facts, where police had already called out to the Complainant to stop, and he was ignoring them with the clear intent of fleeing, I have no hesitation in finding that the actions of theSOwere both necessary and justified in these circumstances.  Clearly, had the Complainant not chosen to flee police after they called on him to stop, there would have been no need to tackle him.In conclusion, I find that the evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the actions of theSO, or any police officer involved in the apprehension of the fleeing Complainant, amounted to an excessive use of force or fell outside of the limits of the criminal law.  Therefore, since I lack the necessary grounds for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	November 5, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=153
,Peel Regional Police,Grey,Ontario,r\n The Complainant also sustained a left nasal bone fracture and a nasal splint was applied which was to be removed a week later,"On December 19, 2017, the Mobile Support Service (MSS) and the Hold-Up Squad of theTPSformed reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant and his co-conspirator were located in a parking garage at a high rise building located on Hanson Road in the City of Mississauga.  Members of theMSSattended the apartment building at 12:30 p.m. and began surveillance of the building for any sighting of the Complainant.Present in the area of the building where the Complainant was suspected as being located were theMSSteam, theTPSETF, and Peel Regional Police (PRP) tactical officers.  Members of theMSSwere positioned at various points both on the street and in the underground parking lot.At 4:10 p.m., a white Mercedes was seen to leave the parking lot, followed by the known silver Mercedes driven by the Complainant.  At 4:12 p.m., once the two motor vehicles, believed to be driven by the two suspected armed robbers, left the parking area,SO#1 gave the go ahead to stop and arrest the drivers; the arrest of these two parties was classified as a ‘high risk takedown’ due to the possible presence of firearms.  Both vehicles were then observed driving northbound on Hanson Road.The plan which had been formulated was that police officers, upon the Complainant leaving the parking garage, would attempt to bring his vehicle to a stop as quickly as possible by making contact with his car.During the course of the attempted apprehension of the Complainant, five unmarked police vehicles made contact with his Mercedes. Thereafter, a foot pursuit followed, when the Complainant abandoned his motor vehicle and attempted to flee on foot.  Two shots were also fired at the Complainant, and he later went over a four foot concrete barrier from the off ramp of Hurontario Street onto Rathburn Road.  During the arrest of the Complainant, he was punched on one occasion by a police officer.  He was later taken to the hospital where it was determined that he had sustained a crush injury to his foot, and a broken nose.During the course of this investigation, only one civilian witness, other than the Complainant, came forward to be interviewed.  The evidence of that one civilian witness related primarily to the pursuit of the Complainant’s motor vehicle, which is not in dispute.The Complainant alleges that as he was leaving the underground parking lot in the silver Mercedes, a minivan drove straight into him.  Soon after, a second minivan drove into his Mercedes on the driver’s side, pushing his Mercedes onto a stretch of lawn, which the Complainant then drove across, as he was scared and unaware that the vehicles that had rammed him were police vehicles and he was unsure whether or not they meant to kill him.The Complainant alleges that as he drove off, turning right onto Hanson Road and then left onto Fairview Road West, he saw several speeding cars behind him, a number of which collided with his motor vehicle at various times. The Complainant then turned left onto Hurontario Street, travelling north. The Complainant saw a car come up on his left side and strike the Mercedes near the front end, pushing it into oncoming traffic. When the Complainant then found himself on the wrong side of the centre median, another vehicle came up and struck the Mercedes, following which the Complainant was able to steer back into the proper lane of traffic, when another car struck it on the right side, causing the right side air bags to deploy.  The Complainant then braked hard, causing one of the vans to strike something in front of him.The Complainant estimated his speed at approximately 70 km/h and described traffic as being heavy.  When the Complainant saw an opening, he pulled out in front of the vehicles chasing him.  The Complainant indicated that he thought he was going to die, so he kept pressing on the gas pedal, while other vehicles continuously slammed into his.  The Complainant stated that he then saw at least three vehicles try to block him in, following which the Complainant was unable to manoeuvre the Mercedes any longer.  At that point, the Complainant recalled being on a road where, if you turned left, you would enter onto Kennedy Road, from which one could proceed onto Highway 410 South.  When the Complainant tried to exit the Mercedes, another car slammed into his driver’s door, and then a second vehicle struck his trunk, causing him to lurch forward.Upon first hearing the Complainant’s version of events, I must admit that I initially met it with incredulity.  The evidence of the police witnesses and the physical evidence, however, is indeed consistent with his version of events, in that at least five unmarked police vehicles rammed the Complainant’s motor vehicle upon his exiting the underground parking garage, during rush hour and in heavy traffic, on a work day, between approximately 4:10 and 4:15 p.m., in a fairly busy area of Mississauga.In order to fully understand the sequence of events, I will outline which officer was driving which vehicle during the attempts to stop and arrest the Complainant:SO#1 was driving a 2015 Toyota Highlander;WO#1, a black Toyota Camry;SO#2, a silver Toyota Sienna minivan;WO#3, a grey Volkswagen Jetta;WO#8, a goldSUV; andWO#2, a grey Nissan MuranoSUV.Witness Officer (WO) #2, in his statement toSIUinvestigators, indicated that he was positioned north of the driveway to the underground garage and that it was his job to pin the passenger side of the silver Mercedes, if it came his way.  AfterWO#2 heard over the police radio that one white and one silver Mercedes had exited the garage, he observed those vehicles to drive to the top of Hanson Road.WO#3 indicated that as the silver Mercedes drove past his location, he drove into the driver side of the Mercedes at about 15 to 20 km/h, but that the Mercedes continued on.WO#2 observed that one police vehicle was in front of the silver Mercedes, while a second was on the passenger side, and a third was behind it.  The police vehicles tried, unsuccessfully, to box in the Complainant’s Mercedes.WO#3 then observed another unmarked police vehicle strike the Complainant’s car, forcing it onto the lawn of a residence, after which the Complainant continued first eastbound and then northbound, onto Hurontario Street, at a high rate of speed, after passing through the intersection on a red light without stopping.At the intersection of Burnhamthorpe Road and Hurontario Street, a second ‘takedown’ attempt was made to stop the Complainant’s vehicle.WO#2 described severalMSSvehicles making contact with the silver Mercedes at Burnhamthorpe Road and, after it was struck by one of the unmarked police cars from behind, it rolled slowly westward.WO#2 then drove up to the Mercedes to pin the driver’s door shut in order to prevent the Complainant from exiting the vehicle.  AsWO#2 approached, he observed the driver’s door beginning to open, and he drove into the door.This was also observed byWO#3, who described the Complainant opening his driver side door when, suddenly, an unmarked police vehicle drove into it causing the door to slam shut.The Complainant was then observed to switch lanes and he sped off northbound in the southbound lanes of Hurontario Street, followed byWO#2.WO#2 described the Complainant returning to the proper lanes of traffic at about Robert Speck Parkway, andWO#2 followed suit.At Rathburn Road and Hurontario Street, Subject Officer (SO) #1 initiated the final takedown, striking the Complainant’s motor vehicle from behind and causing it to spin, ending up facing southbound in the northbound lanes.  SeveralMSSvehicles then converged on the Mercedes, boxing it in, withWO#1 driving into the passenger side of the Complainant’s car,WO#3 striking it at the rear, andSO#2 striking it on the passenger side.Upon arrival at the scene,SIUinvestigators observed three motor vehicles directly in contact with the Complainant’s Mercedes, while the Toyota Highlander operated bySO#1 was a short distance away, where it had come to a stop after striking the Mercedes and pushing it forward.  The other three vehicles located still in direct contact with the Mercedes were: the grey Volkswagen Jetta, having been operated byWO#3; a Toyota Sienna minivan, the airbags of which had deployed, operated bySO#2; and, a black Toyota Camry, which was operated byWO#1.Once the Mercedes was no longer operable, the Complainant stated that he exited through the driver’s door and ran off.  The Complainant, while he was running, looked to his right and saw a van speeding toward him, and he moved out of the way.  Shortly thereafter, he observed another van driving towards him, and he believed that both wheels on the driver’s side drove over his left foot.WO#2 indicated that after the Mercedes was boxed in, he drove around the stopped cars and observed the Complainant running across the southbound lanes of traffic in a northwest direction.WO#2 then drove over the centre median of Hurontario Street and across three lanes of traffic to get ahead of the Complainant.WO#2 stated that he cut the Complainant off at the top of the ramp by using his vehicle to prevent him from running further north and he observed the Complainant run into the driver’s side of his police vehicle. WhileWO#2 opined that this may have been the cause of the Complainant’s injury, I note that contrary to the evidence of the Complainant,WO#2 was operating a greySUV, and not a minivan.WO#8, likeWO#2, then also drove across the centre median and drove in the southbound lanes of traffic in the direction towards which the Complainant had run.WO#2 then exited his vehicle carrying his C-8 Carbine rifle and pursued the Complainant on foot, down the foot ramp leading to Rathburn Road West.WO#2 was roughly 20 to 30 feet behind the Complainant and he observed the Complainant to be running in a normal fashion, with no indications that he had a foot injury.WO#8 indicated that when the Complainant was running down the foot ramp, withSO#1 andWO#2 in foot pursuit, he saw the Complainant’s right hand come up out of his jacket and then saw the Complainant turn his right shoulder towardsSO#1 andWO#2.  It appeared toWO#8 at that point that the Complainant threw a gun over a fence.WhileSO#1 declined to provide a statement,WO#1 indicated thatSO#1 had told him, after the fact, that the Complainant had pulled out a firearm during the foot pursuit and tossed it over a fence.WO#3 indicated that he observed the Complainant throw a gun in a northerly direction towards a creek and, at the same time, he heard two shots being fired, which he believed had originated fromSO#1; the Complainant continued running.WO#3 also observed that once the Complainant reached the bottom of the foot ramp, he stopped and was unable to stand on both feet, thereafter rolling himself over the concrete barrier.At 5:07 p.m.,WO#4 located a black revolver, with two chambered rounds, submerged in the water.  The firearm was photographed in place, then seized and examined.WO#8 advised that once the Complainant was at the bottom of the ramp, the Complainant turned to faceWO#8’s vehicle and then rolled over a concrete barrier separating the ramp from Rathburn Road.WO#8 described the Complainant going over the barrier feet first and then dropping roughly four to five feet down to Rathburn Road.WO#8 advised that the Complainant did not move from where he had fallen, and that upon his arrival,SO#1 was already on top of the Complainant, and was being assisted byWO#2 andWO#1.The Complainant alleges that he was then tackled to the ground and ended up lying on his stomach, but he did not see who tackled him.  He was then thrown over a four foot high concrete barrier by some people, who he could not identify.According toWO#1, once the Complainant exited his vehicle, he was pursued on foot bySO#1 andWO#2, followed by himself.  As the Complainant reached the bottom of the ramp,WO#1 described him as slowing and flinging himself over the top of the cement barrier, following which he observedSO#1 andWO#2 make contact with the Complainant and place him under arrest.  Seconds later,WO#1 arrived at the arrest scene, followed bySO#2 andWO#8, who were in an unmarked police vehicle.WO#2 described observing the Complainant start to climb over the barrier using his right arm, followed by his right leg, and then fall to the ground.WO#2 believed at that time that the Complainant had collapsed.The Complainant indicated that he then saw five to six white police officers in plainclothes and black and grey tactical gear.  The Complainant told the police officers that his foot was broken but was told to “shut up or we are going to break your leg,” at which point an officer grabbed his leg and squeezed his foot.At one point, the Complainant alleges he was punched in the face by a police officer, following which he put his hands over his face and yelled, “I’m done.  I didn’t know it was the police.  I’m done!”  When his hands were moved away from his face, it felt as if his nose was broken and he opined that it had been broken when the officer punched him.  The Complainant then had the back of his head banged against the ground.WO#8 stated that he observedWO#1 take control of the Complainant’s legs to stop him from kicking, whileWO#8 took control of his upper body.WO#8 ordered the Complainant to stop resisting and to show his hands, but when the Complainant did not respond,WO#8 used his right fist and punched the Complainant on the top of his head as hard as he could.WO#8 placed the resistance by the Complainant as a ten out of ten for severity.  After punching the Complainant,WO#8 pulled the Complainant’s arms out from under him and he was then handcuffed.With respect to how he received his injuries, the Complainant does not allege that he was injured during the vehicular pursuit, which involved five police vehicles ramming his motor vehicle at various points.  He alleges, however, that a van drove over his left foot, with both tires, crushing it and causing the injury to his foot.  He also alleges that during his arrest, a police officer punched him in the face, which he believed broke his nose.  The Complainant also indicated that prior to his apprehension, he was thrown over a four foot concrete barrier and, during his arrest, his head was banged against the ground and a police officer grabbed his leg and squeezed his broken foot, threatening to break it.  The Complainant is not able to distinguish specifically between the many police officers involved in his pursuit and arrest, and therefore is unable to identify any specific police officer as being responsible for his injuries.While the Complainant’s description of the police pursuit and the ramming of his motor vehicle is substantially corroborated by the police officers involved and the physical evidence at the scene, I find that his assertion that he was at no time in possession of a firearm, when he was specifically seen to pull a gun from somewhere on his person and throw it into a body of water below by at least three different police witnesses, and it was later located and photographed in that exact location, causes me some doubts as to his reliability, if not his credibility.  As such, while I have relied on the Complainant’s version of events where it is materially corroborated by either the physical evidence or the evidence of other witnesses, I am unable to base my decision on the uncorroborated evidence of the Complainant alone.I also do not accept the Complainant’s assertion that he was thrown over the concrete barrier, as numerous of the police officers present observed him to go over the barrier of his own accord and unaided by any police officer, in his bid to escape.Based on the evidence of the Complainant, it is clear that he was not injured during the police pursuit or the ramming of his vehicle, but he was only injured after he had fled from his disabled vehicle and a van drove over his foot, with both wheels on its driver’s side.While the evidence ofWO#1, as confirmed by the physical evidence at the scene, indicates thatSO#1,WO#3,WO#1, andSO#2 all drove their vehicles into the Complainant’s Mercedes during the final takedown attempt, and that those four motor vehicles remained at the collision scene, where they were located thereafter bySIUinvestigators with three of those vehicles still in contact with the Complainant’s vehicle, while the fourth,SO#1’s Toyota Highlander, was located stopped just prior to the point where the Complainant’s motor vehicle came to rest, it is clear that the operators of those four motor vehicles could not have driven the vehicle which allegedly drove over the Complainant’s foot, having each abandoned their motor vehicles and pursued the Complainant on foot prior to him sustaining his injury.Furthermore, while the Complainant described two vans as driving at him while he was running away, one of which he was able to avoid, and the second which drove over his left foot, there is no evidence as to who was operating either of these two vehicles, insomuch as the Complainant was not able to describe the colour or make of either van.  The evidence at the collision scene reveals only one apparently disabled van, a Toyota Sienna which had been operated bySO#2, and a largeSUV, the Toyota Highlander which had been operated bySO#1, neither of which could have run over the Complainant’s foot as they remained in the area of the final collision scene.The only evidence of any motor vehicle pursuing the Complainant in the direction that he fled, once he was on foot, was that ofWO#2 who was operating a grey Nissan Murano[1], andWO#8, who drove a gold colouredSUVwhich never came anywhere near the Complainant.  As such, if it indeed was a van that ran over the Complainant’s foot, I find it impossible to pinpoint which motor vehicle, operated by whom, may have been the vehicle involved in the Complainant’s injury.Furthermore, it seems unlikely that as the Complainant was running, that a van could have run over his left foot with both the front and rear driver side tires, which one would think would require the Complainant to be facing the side of the motor vehicle, and not running either parallel to, or in front of, the motor vehicle.[2]While there is some corroboration, in the form of the medical evidence that the injury to the Complainant’s foot was caused by a crush type injury[3], that the Complainant’s foot was indeed damaged by the application of some force which crushed his bones, I am unable, without significant speculation on the evidence before me, to determine who, or how, that might have occurred.  In the absence of that evidence, I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that any one particular police officer drove a motor vehicle in such a manner as to cause the injury to the Complainant.While the appropriate charge to be considered, should the driver of the van be capable of being identified, would be one of dangerous driving causing bodily harm, the definition of which is set out in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R v Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, as requiring that the driving must be dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place, and that the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances,” in the absence of some identification evidence to pinpoint who the driver of the van who allegedly drove over the Complainant’s foot is, I lack the evidence necessary to assess that driving overall to determine whether or not the driving was dangerous in nature in the entire context of the incident.While the one civilian witness who observed the police pursuit observed two pickup trucks and four sedans driving through an intersection against a red light, in pursuit of the Complainant’s motor vehicle, honking their horns in order to alert other motorists, there is no evidence that this group of six motor vehicles included the alleged van which ran over the Complainant’s foot.Furthermore, since none of the unmarked motor vehicles had eitherGPS/Automobile Vehicle Locator (AVL) data or in-car camera systems, there is no evidence as to the speed of any of the pursuing police vehicles.  While the Complainant estimated his own speed at 70 km/h while being pursued and managing to outrun the police, there appears little evidence that the police vehicles were driving at an excessive rate of speed, even could I isolate the alleged van as being one of these motor vehicles.As such, in the absence of some evidence to identify the driver of the van which the Complainant alleges drove over his foot, I am unable to satisfy myself that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant’s injured foot was caused by the dangerous driving of an unknown police officer.With respect to the Complainant’s allegation that a police officer, who is again unidentifiable, punched the Complainant in the face breaking his nose, I am also unable to find that the evidence is capable of satisfying me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that this occurred, in light of the diminished reliability and credibility of the Complainant, as indicated above.I do note, however, thatWO#8 indicated that he did indeed strike the Complainant on the top of the head when he was resisting his arrest, which resistance he rated as falling at a ten on a scale of one to ten in severity. While it appears unlikely that this punch to the top of the head could have caused his broken nose, even had it done so, I cannot find that this amounted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances.  While taking into account that the Complainant was known to have previously been in possession of a firearm, he had successfully managed to elude police in three successive takedown attempts, he had then fled from police on foot, and had been seen to be holding a firearm on his person which only a couple of the officers had seen him discard, I have no doubt that there was a heightened sense of urgency to handcuff the Complainant as quickly as possible, in order to eliminate the risk that he continued to pose, as long as he was at large and possibly in possession of a firearm.[4]Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order forWO#8 to qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.On the evidence before me, it is clear that there was ample evidence upon which to apprehend and arrest the Complainant for the outstanding offences of armed robbery, making his pursuit and subsequent arrest actions in furtherance of a lawful duty.  The question remains, however, whether or not the punch to the head of the Complainant was reasonable and justified in the circumstances.  As enumerated above, taking into account the known fact of a firearm and the many efforts by the Complainant to escape, I have no hesitation in finding that the single punch inflicted byWO#8 was justified, in these circumstances, in order to restrain and handcuff the Complainant as quickly as possible and to search him for any additional weapons.In making this finding, I have considered the direction from the Supreme Court of Canada as set out inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.As such, while I am unable to determine that the single punch delivered byWO#8 was the source of the Complainant’s injured nose, finding it far more likely that he was injured when he rolled over the concrete barrier and then collapsed onto the ground, even were I able to do so, I am not satisfied on these facts that there are reasonable grounds to believe thatWO#8 acted outside of the limits of the criminal law in these circumstances.With respect to the Complainant’s broken foot, in the absence of some evidence as to how and by whom this injury occurred, the evidence is incapable of satisfying me on reasonable grounds that his injury occurred as a result of any specific police officer driving in a dangerous manner.  However, even if the injury was sustained, as opined byWO#2, when he drove his vehicle so as to cut off the Complainant’s escape, and the Complainant ran into his police vehicle, I would not find that action byWO#2, in this dynamic and dangerous situation, to fall outside of the limits of the criminal law.  As such, as I lack the basis for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	November 8, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=137
,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,It was however confirmed by two of the police officers present when the Complainant was X-rayed and who spoke with the attending physician that the Complainant had sustained a fracture to his fifth left rib,"At 6:45:22 p.m., the officers arrived at the store and, shortly thereafter, a police radio transmission was heard requesting the attendance of a police sergeant as the male in the washroom was armed with a knife. At 6:51:09 p.m., the Emergency Task Force (ETF) was dispatched to the store to deal with the male; numerous other units were also dispatched to assist with clearing the store, if necessary.As of 7:15:48 p.m., the back-up units, as well as theETF, began to arrive at the Walmart store.  At 7:47:33 p.m., a radio transmission was received that the male had been taken into custody, following which he was transported to the police station, and thereafter to the hospital.  X-rays taken at the hospital revealed that the Complainant had sustained a fracture to the fifth rib on his left side, but that no treatment was required other than a prescription for pain medication, after which the Complainant was returned to the police station.During the course of this investigation, in addition to the Complainant, two civilian and eight police witnesses were interviewed, as well as one of the three subject officers,SO#2; the remaining two subject officers declined to make themselves available to be interviewed bySIUinvestigators and all three subject officers declined to provide their memorandum book notes for review, as was their legal right.  In addition,SIUinvestigators had access to, and reviewed, the memo book notes of 12 witness police officers, an audio recording of the interaction between theETFand the Complainant, as well as the 911 call and police transmissions recordings.While the Complainant opted not to consent to the release of his medical records, it is clear from the information provided by the attending doctor at the time, as well as the X-rays which were taken in the presence of a police officer, that the Complainant had sustained a fractured rib.  While there is some evidence, that being that the Complainant had some injuries to his face which appeared to have been pre-existing and which indicate that the Complainant may have been involved in some type of physical confrontation prior to his involvement with police on that date, I have proceeded on the basis that it is possible that the Complainant’s rib was injured during his arrest on December 13, 2017.While there are several points of disagreement as between the accounts of the incident of the police and the Complainant as to what occurred on December 13, 2017, relating primarily to the actions of the Complainant, there is no material dispute as between the version of events provided by the Complainant, the civilian witnesses, and the police officers as to the actions of the involved police officers, or the amount of force that they resorted to in arresting the Complainant.  A summary of the facts garnered from the reliable evidence follows.At some point during the afternoon of December 13, 2017, and no later than 5:10 p.m., according to Walmart staff members, the Complainant locked himself into the family washroom inside the store.  After several attempts to convince the Complainant to exit, and as he had a history of locking himself into the store washroom for hours at a time, at the request of the assistant store manager,CW#1, the loss prevention manager,CW#2, called 911 and requested police attendance in order to remove the Complainant from the washroom, and ultimately from the premises.In response to the 911 call,WO#4 andWO#5 arrived at the store and also attempted to convince the Complainant to exit, but he continued to refuse to do so.CW#1 then provided the officers with a key to the washroom, following which they unlocked the door; the Complainant, however, was pushing on the door from the inside, attempting to prevent the officers’ entry into the washroom.  According toWO#4 andWO#5, as soon as they pushed the door open and entered, they observed the Complainant standing to their right in an aggressive manner, withWO#4 observing that the Complainant had a knife. The Complainant then yelled out, “I have a knife!” whereuponWO#4 immediately pulledWO#5 out of the washroom.WO#5, as he was being pulled back byWO#4, also observed the knife, which was described as having a black handle and a silver blade of between three to five inches in length.According to the Complainant, the object which he grabbed when the officers entered the washroom was a piece of metal from the wipes dispenser; however, both of the civilian witnesses heardWO#4 state, “He has a knife!” and a knife was later located hidden behind an emergency light over top of the washroom door.  On the basis of this evidence, which directly and satisfactorily refutes the evidence of the Complainant, I am satisfied that the Complainant was indeed armed with a knife whenWO#4 andWO#5 entered the washroom, and that he was holding it in his right hand in a threatening manner.As soon as the officers backed out of the washroom, the Complainant again locked the door behind them.WO#4 then radioed for additional units whileWO#5 attempted to engage the Complainant in conversation, through the locked door, asking the Complainant his name and why he had locked himself in the washroom, with the Complainant identifying himself with a false name and a false date of birth, and advising that he had locked himself in the washroom because Walmart staff had wanted him to come out before he was ready.These events are all fully confirmed by the two independent civilian witnesses, as well as the recording of the police radio transmissions, in which the Complainant is identified as possibly being a party with the false name as provided.Upon arrival of theETFofficers, an audio recording was commenced, whereinSO#1 is heard to attempt to build a rapport with the Complainant through the locked door;SO#1 is repeatedly heard to refer to the Complainant with the false first name provided and to try to convince him to exit, while letting him know that if he did not do so voluntarily, the police would have no other option but to force their way in and remove him.SO#1 is also repeatedly heard to ask the Complainant if he might be ready to come out on his own soon.Finally, after negotiation over a fairly lengthy period of time, a decision was made by theETFteam that the door would be breached and that the officers would enter and forcefully remove the Complainant.  At 7:43 p.m., a device known as a ‘Rabbit’ (a hydraulic door-opening device) was used to open the washroom door in a slow and controlled manner, whereupon the Complainant was immediately seen standing inside the washroom facing the police.SO#1 ordered the Complainant to move to the back wall, following whichSO#1 entered the washroom, followed bySO#3, who was equipped with a shield, andSO#2, who was armed with a ‘BIP’ (a ‘Blunt Impact Projectile’, a long gun which fires less lethal projectiles, such as rubber bullets or beanbags).According to the Complainant, he recalled a police officer talking to him through the closed door and telling him that the police were going to come in, following which ten or 12 ‘SWAT’ officers entered the washroom, he was ordered to go to the back wall, and he complied with their directions.  He was then taken down onto the floor, but could not recall how that was done, following which he was handcuffed and turned over toWO#4 andWO#5, who took him to the hospital.  The Complainant recalled that once at the hospital, he was X-rayed and told that he had a broken rib, which the Complainant attributed to his being taken to the floor by theETFofficers.  The Complainant does not allege that he was ever punched, kicked, or otherwise injured by the police in any way.The evidence of the Complainant is consistent in this regard with that of theETFofficers present, who all agree that once the door was opened,SO#1 issued clear commands for the Complainant to go to the rear wall of the washroom and to turn and face the wall in a kneeling position, with both hands on his head, which the Complainant then did.SO#3 then advanced toward the Complainant, while holding a large shield extended in front of him, with which he pressed the Complainant against the wall.SO#1 then advanced and took hold of the Complainant’s left wrist/arm, whileSO#2 took the Complainant’s right wrist.SO#3 then started to ease the pressure on the shield, by which he had been holding the Complainant in place, and the Complainant was seen to be on his knees, with his back to theETFofficers and his hands above his head.  As the pressure on the shield eased, the Complainant snatched his right hand away fromSO#2 and turned, so that his right shoulder was now closest to the wall, and he was perpendicular to the wall, rather than facing it.  Because the Complainant was now non-compliant, and the knife had not yet been located, the Complainant was forced to the ground from his kneeling position.  The Complainant was then seen to be face down on the floor with his right arm pinned underneath his body.WhileSO#2 had been somewhat hampered by the ‘BIP’, which he had on a sling around his neck,WO#2 then moved in and took the ‘BIP’ fromSO#2, allowingSO#2 to use both of his hands to regain control of the Complainant’s right hand and to pull it out from underneath his body and behind his back, where he was then handcuffed.  No punches, kicks, distractionary blows, or use of force options were used by any officer against the Complainant, with the only force used being to initially pin him with the shield, and then to take him to the ground from a kneeling position.  The Complainant was then turned over toWO#4 andWO#5, who transported him first to the police station and then to the hospital, where he was assessed and it was discovered that he had sustained a fractured fifth rib.While the Complainant had no recollection of going to the police station prior to being taken to hospital, that evidence is confirmed by both the in-car camera video from the scout car ofWO#4 andWO#5, as well as the booking video from the police station.  Of particular note on the booking video, is that the Complainant is non-communicative; when he speaks, his speech is slurred and he appears to be incapable of understanding the questions asked of him, he provides two different false names while identifying himself, and he is unsteady on his feet and is seen to be wobbling back and forth while being supported byWO#4 andWO#5, at which point the booking staff sergeant directs the officers to take the Complainant to the hospital.  On the basis of this additional evidence, in addition to the finding of the knife and the evidence of the two civilian witnesses, I find that the Complainant’s evidence, while substantially consistent with that of the other witnesses, is not reliable in at least these two identified aspects, which indicate to me that the Complainant does not have an accurate recollection of events.  As such, where his evidence differs from that of the other witnesses, I reject his evidence in favour of that of the other witnesses.Despite that, however, there is some evidence that the Complainant was seriously injured during his interaction with police, requiring an assessment to determine whether or not the actions ofSO#2,SO#1, andSO#3, in apprehending and arresting the Complainant, amounted to an excessive use of force in the circumstances, thereby vitiating their protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25 (1) of theCriminal Code.Pursuant to s. 25(1), a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order for the three subject officers to qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that they were in the execution of a lawful duty, that they were acting on reasonable grounds, and that they used no more force than was necessary in executing that lawful duty.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from the information provided by the 911 caller, as confirmed at the scene byCW#1 andCW#2, thatSO#1,SO#2, andSO#3, had reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was in breach of s. 2 (1) of theTrespass to Property Act(TPA) when he failed to leave the family washroom when directed to do so byCW#1 andCW#2,  and that the officers were thereafter authorized, pursuant to s. 9 of theTPA, to arrest and remove the Complainant from the property.  As such, the apprehension and subsequent arrest of the Complainant by all three officers was legally justified in the circumstances.An assessment of the use of force resorted to by the three subject officers, then, requires an assessment of whether pinning the Complainant with the shield, and then taking him to the floor from a kneeling position when he became non-compliant with the police officers, and with the knowledge that the Complainant had been earlier seen armed with a knife, although the knife had not yet, at that time, been located, amounts to an excessive use of force.   On these facts, I cannot find that these actions, despite the possible injury to the Complainant (I say possible, because there is some evidence that he may have had some pre-existing injury), amounted to an excessive use of force on the part of any of the officers who dealt with the Complainant.  In fact, I find that the actions of these three officers, and all of the officers who interacted with the Complainant, exhibited calm, patience, and professionalism, and that no more than the minimal force required was used to contain and possibly disarm the Complainant, before anyone came to harm.In making this finding, I have considered the direction from the Supreme Court of Canada as set out inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.In conclusion, while it is quite possible that the Complainant sustained his serious injury when he was taken to the ground by the three subject officers, the evidence does not satisfy me that there are any grounds, reasonable or otherwise, to find that this action amounted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances or that any of the involved officers acted outside of the limits of the criminal law when they restrained and apprehended a resistant male who had earlier been seen to be armed with a dangerous weapon.  As such, as I lack the bases for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	December 7, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=158

,Ontario Provincial Police,Renfrew,Ontario,nCause of Death On October 19 2018 the Final Post-Mortem Report was received by the SIU wherein it was confirmed that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the neck and head,"As a result, at 2:47:03 p.m., numerousOPPunits, from both the Smiths Falls and the Killaloe Detachments, were dispatched to the residence.A call back from the dispatcher toCW#1 revealed that the Complainant owned hunting rifles, butCW#1 was unable to determine if any of them were missing, as the gun cabinet was locked; the Complainant had sent her a text message at 2:07 p.m. telling her that there was a note in the basement; and, there was a lot of smoke coming from the back of the their property.At 3:04 p.m., the Subject Officer (SO) arrived at the Complainant’s residence and observed the smoke coming from the back of the property.  TheSOspoke briefly withCW#1; he obtained the Complainant’s cell phone number which he then relayed to the dispatcher in order that the Internet Service Provider (ISP) could be contacted and the cell phone of the Complainant could be triangulated in order to confirm its location; he read both the text message and the note in the basement from the Complainant, in each of which the Complainant had indicated an intention to end his own life; and, he checked the gun cabinet, but found it to be locked.The dispatcher advised theSOthat theISPhad confirmed that the Complainant’s cell phone was within 200 metres of the residence.At 3:07 p.m., Witness Officer (WO) #1 arrived at the residence and he and theSOwent into the brush at the back of the residence, where they observed the smoke.At 3:15 p.m., theSOwas heard to transmit on his radio that he had seen the fire, but had not yet located the Complainant.At 3:16 p.m.,WO#1 transmitted that he had sighted the Complainant and requested that additional officers attend.WO#1 then used the loudspeaker from the cruiser to request that the Complainant exit the brush so that they could talk.  There was no response.TheSOthen saw the Complainant moving about behind the brush, following which the Complainant sat down.  TheSOasked the Complainant what was going on, but the Complainant did not respond.  TheSOthen observed the barrel of a shotgun between the Complainant’s legs and theSOyelled out to alertWO#1 to the presence of a firearm.TheSOwithdrew his firearm and held it in the low ready position, but when he saw that the Complainant did not have the shotgun pointed in his direction, but rather had lifted the barrel of the shotgun and placed it under his chin, theSOre-holstered his firearm and drew his Conducted Energy Weapon (CEW).WO#1 told the Complainant to drop the gun, but he refused to do so.  TheSO, in an attempt to incapacitate the Complainant and prevent him from taking his own life, discharged hisCEW.  On the evidence of both theSOandWO#1, it appears that theCEWand the shotgun were discharged simultaneously and, even before the probes of theCEWmade contact, the shotgun shell entered the Complainant’s body and he fell backwards.At 3:18:21 p.m., theSOwas heard to radio that a shot had been fired and that a Taser (CEW) had been deployed.  A second transmission was received at 3:18:44 p.m. that the Complainant had shot himself in the head.  At 3:20:18 p.m.,WO#1 radioed that the Complainant was “10-45”, or dead.On the evidence of both theSOandWO#1 that theCEWand the shotgun were discharged simultaneously, that there was no visible reaction from the Complainant to theCEW, as well as the fact that only one of the probes made contact with the Complainant’s body with both probes later found embedded in his clothing, I find that there is no evidence to indicate that the deployment of theCEWhad any effect whatsoever on the Complainant.  I also find that the Complainant discharged his shotgun despite the efforts of theSOandWO#1 to prevent him doing so, as had clearly been his plan pursuant to both his previous text message and his note in the basement.It is clear on a review of all of the evidence, that the Complainant was intent on taking his own life and had planned and taken all steps to carry out his intention, from texting his wife, to writing a suicide note/will for his loved ones and leaving it in the basement for his wife to find, to taking his firearm from the locked gun cabinet, and to going out into the woods after texting his wife as to his intention.The response by theOPPwas swift and extensive, with numerous officers being dispatched to the residence and the first officer, theSO, arriving at the scene within 19 minutes of the initial call.  Despite the best efforts of theSOandWO#1 to prevent the stated intention of the Complainant to take his own life, it is clear that the Complainant had made up his mind and was intent on achieving that goal, and he acted on that intention without any verbal or physical interaction with police, and before the police had the opportunity to intervene.The only criminal charge open for consideration on these facts would be one of criminal negligence causing death contrary to s.220 of theCriminal Code.  There is no dispute that the death of the Complainant was not in any way attributable to the actions of theSOorWO#1, the only question being whether or not theSOorWO#1 failed in their duty toward the Complainant.  Specifically, the question to be posed is whether theSOorWO#1 omitted to do anything that it was their duty to do and, in failing to do so, showed a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of the Complainant (s.219 of theCriminal Code:  definition of criminal negligence).There are numerous decisions of the higher courts defining the requirements to prove an offence of criminal negligence; while most relate to offences involving driving, the courts have made it clear that the same principles apply to other behaviour as well.  In order to find reasonable grounds to believe that theSOorWO#1 committed the offence of criminal negligence causing death, one must first have reasonable grounds to believe that they had a duty toward the Complainant which they omitted to carry out, and that omission, pursuant to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. J.F.(2008), 3 S.C.R. 215, represented ‘amarked and substantial departurefrom the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in circumstances’ where theSOorWO#1 ‘either recognized and ran an obvious and serious risk to the life’ of the Complainant ‘or, alternatively, gave no thought to that risk’.  The courts have also made clear that the risk of death to the Complainant must have been foreseeable in the circumstances (R. v. Shilon(2006), 240 C.C.C. (3d) 401 Ont. C.A.).On this evidence, I cannot find that the actions of either theSOorWO#1 amounted to an omission to carry out their duties, nor did they amount to ‘amarked and substantial departurefrom the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances’.  While the actions of the Complainant, as a result of the information received in the 911 call, the notes authored by the Complainant, and his attending in the brush with his firearm, would clearly have made his suicide foreseeable, I cannot find that the police service, or theSOandWO#1 specifically, could possibly have done more than they did to prevent the Complainant’s death.Rather than reasonable grounds to believe that theSOand/orWO#1 showed a wanton and reckless disregard for the life or safety of the Complainant, it appears that they were in fact actively seeking to assist him and to prevent him from taking his own life.  In all, the response by theOPPwas swift and substantial.  Unfortunately, the Complainant had clearly made up his mind to end his life and he too acted swiftly when he saw that police had arrived, and before either of theSOorWO#1 could take any action to save his life.  As soon as theSOwent to discharge hisCEW, the Complainant almost simultaneously discharged his shotgun, thereby ending his own life and thwarting the efforts of police to the contrary.On this record, I cannot find reasonable grounds to believe that the actions of either of theSOorWO#1 satisfy any of the elements required in order to pursue a charge under s.220 of theCriminal Codein that they neither omitted to carry out any duty to act; nor did their actions amount to a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in their circumstances; and neither did they not show a wanton or reckless disregard for the life or safety of the Complainant.  Additionally, despite their best efforts, it was not within the power of either officer to prevent the Complainant’s subsequent and tragic death.On all of the evidence, it is clear that the death of the Complainant was as a result of his own voluntary actions and there is no causal connection between the actions of theSOorWO#1 and the death of the Complainant.  On this record, I can find no basis for the laying of criminal charges nor any basis for the assignment of blame, and no charges shall issue.Date:	October 23, 2018Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=82

,Toronto Police Service,Grey,Ontario,n nOn Friday December 1 2017 at approximately 11:15 p.m CW 3 was in his neighbour’s backyard when he called 911 He reported that four unknown men with firearms were trying to rob his house CW 3 then told the operator that the four men had fled and were running southbound on Benshire Drive in the City of Toronto At approximately 11:17 p.m the SO and WO 3 were driving on Benshire Drive when they saw four men running towards Bendale Junior Public BJP School The SO and WO 3 exited their vehicle and ran after the men One of the men later identified as the Complainant was lagging behind the other men The SO and WO 3 followed the Complainant into the school yard The Complainant was carrying a canister of bear repellent spray He discharged the spray at WO 3 and continued to run around the portable classrooms The Complainant was holding something which appeared to be a firearm and pointed it towards the SO The SO believed the Complainant had a firearm in his hands He discharged his firearm multiple times at the Complainant The Complainant began to run The SO ran after the Complainant He then saw the Complainant raising his arm towards WO 3 in a similar manner to that of shooting a firearm The SO discharged his firearm at the Complainant again The Complainant ran and hid behind a large industrial garbage bin The SO and WO 3 approached the Complainant and arrested him The Complainant sustained a gunshot wound to his right arm and was transported to hospital in an ambulance nNature of Injury/Treatment On Saturday December 2 2018 the Complainant underwent surgery for a single gunshot wound to his right arm The bullet entered the volar surface on the lateral side of the Complainant’s upper right forearm and travelled through muscle striking the lateral side of the distal humerus before it came to rest behind the right humerus bone The bullet was retrieved from the Complainant’s right forearm A medical opinion received indicated that in order for the bullet to have entered the Complainant’s right forearm in the manner it did the Complainant would have had to have been facing the person who fired at him n,"According to theSO, as he andWO#3 arrived on Benshire Drive, he saw four unknown men running southbound on Benshire Drive toward the BJP School.  Two of the men, one of whom was later identified as the Complainant, ran on a pathway leading into the school yard from the parking lot.  TheSOdrove into the parking lot and exited his police vehicle and ran after the Complainant.WO#3 indicated that as soon as theSOstopped the car, he exited and ran around the school bus leading into the school yard.WO#3 observed two men running toward the school yard but he did not know the location of theSOat that time.WO#3 ran past the portables after the two individuals.  He then observed the Complainant about 30 feet ahead of him and he yelled at the Complainant to stop running.WO#3 indicated that he yelled, “Police! Stop!” four times and then ran after the Complainant.WO#3 observed the Complainant with something in his right hand, following which he lost sight of the Complainant andWO#3 stopped running.WO#3 advised that he slowed and approached the portables cautiously as he did not know if the Complainant was just around the corner.  As he came around one of the portables,WO#3 saw the Complainant with his hands in front of him holding an object thatWO#3 equated as being similar to holding a firearm.WO#3, who was approximately 30 feet from the Complainant, feared for his safety and immediately drew his firearm.AsWO#3 pointed his firearm at the Complainant, he felt a burst of spray towards him and then observed that the Complainant was in possession of a canister of bear repellent.WO#3 took a few steps backward as a result of coming into contact with the bear spray.  The Complainant then again ran away andWO#3 lost sight of the Complainant as he went around the portable classroom, where it was very dark.AsWO#3 followed in the same direction, he heard several gunshots and he immediately relayed that information over his police radio.  He then observed the Complainant running away from the portables toward the parking lot, followed by theSO.WO#3 observed theSOwith his firearm drawn and estimated that he was approximately 10 feet behind the Complainant.WO#3 then lost sight of both men as he ran toward the parking lot.TheSOstated that he repeatedly yelled at the Complainant to stop and get on the ground.   TheSOdescribed the area near the portables as poorly lit and he was unaware of the location ofWO#3 at that time.   TheSOobserved the Complainant turn around and remove an object from his left waistband and point it at theSOin a manner described by theSOas similar to pointing a firearm.   TheSObelieved that the Complainant was going to shoot him and he feared for his safety, as a result of which he unholstered his firearm and shot at the Complainant multiple times.The Complainant then turned and ran way and theSOdiscarded his magazine and reloaded his firearm with a second magazine and followed. TheSOdescribed himself as being approximately 20 feet behind the Complainant and, after he had run about 30 feet, he saw the Complainant raise his hands and point the object in his possession atWO#3, again in a manner which theSOassociated with pointing a firearm.  TheSOfeared for the safety ofWO#3 and he immediately discharged his firearm multiple times at the Complainant, but the Complainant continued to run away.This evidence is confirmed by that ofCW#3, who was present in the school yard and observed the Complainant point a black coloured object, which he described as being similar to a firearm, atWO#3.  He indicated that he heardWO#3 repeatedly yell at the Complainant to put his hands on his head and to get on the ground; the Complainant did neither.CW#3 then observed theSOshoot at the Complainant.CW#3 indicated that he then heard ten more gunshots, and when he looked out from behind the police vehicle, he observed theSOon his knees behind a large industrial garbage bin with his hands on his face and he described theSOas appearing traumatized.TheSOstated that he lost sight of the Complainant behind three large industrial garbage bins.  When theSOran around the bins, he located the Complainant crouched behind one of the bins.  TheSOtold the Complainant to get on the ground, and then theSOpushed him down towards the ground. The Complainant then lay on the ground with his right arm underneath his body.  TheSOfeared that the Complainant might still be in possession of a firearm, and he began to pull on the Complainant’s right hand.WO#3 then arrived and assisted and they were able to remove the Complainant’s arm from beneath his body and he was handcuffed.WO#3 also advised that he next came upon theSOand the Complainant behind an industrial garbage bin where he observed theSOstruggling with the Complainant.WO#3 observed the large bear repellent spray canister next to the Complainant. The Complainant had his hands underneath his body andWO#3 assisted theSOin getting the Complainant’s hands out and he was handcuffed.TheSOthen performed a pat-down search of the Complainant, at which time his hand came away with blood, as a result of which he immediately radioed for an ambulance.  TheSOalso observed a large canister of bear repellent spray near the garbage bins.WO#3 indicated that theSOtold him that he thought that the Complainant had a firearm.The evidence provided by both theSOandWO#3, and byCW#3, is confirmed by the various recordings which I have already outlined above.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Codeof Canada, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.Further, pursuant to subsection 3:(3)  Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of anyone under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.As such, in order for theSOto qualify for protection from prosecution under section 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.  Furthermore, pursuant to subsection 3, if death or grievous bodily harm is caused, it must further be established that the police officer did so believing on reasonable grounds that it was necessary in order to preserve himself, or anyone under his protection, from death or grievous bodily harm.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from the 911 call fromCW#3 that the Complainant was one of four men[1]that had just broken into his home and “robbed” him and that the men were armed.  On the basis of that information, which was relayed by the dispatcher to the responding officers, it is clear that when theSOandWO#3 saw four men running away fromCW#3’s residence toward the public school[2], that they had reasonable grounds to believe that these were the armed robbers described byCW#3.  As such, the pursuit and apprehension of the Complainant was legally justified in the circumstances.With respect to the other requirements pursuant to s.25 (1) and (3), I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]The court describes the test required under s.25 as follows:Section 25(1) essentially provides that a police officer is justified in using force to effect a lawful arrest, provided that he or she acted on reasonable and probable grounds and used only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances. That is not the end of the matter. Section 25 (3) also prohibits a police officer from using a greater degree of force, i.e. that which is intended or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm, unless he or she believes that it is necessary to protect him- or herself, or another person under his or her protection, from death or grievous bodily harm. The officer's belief must be objectively reasonable. This means that the use of force under s. 25 (3) is to be judged on a subjective-objective basis (Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634 (QL) (S.C.J.), at para. 59).The decision of Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice inChartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634, as adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada above, sets out other relevant provisions of theCriminal Codeto be considered, as follows:27. 	Use of force to prevent commission of offence - Everyone is justified in using as much force as is reasonably necessary(a)	to prevent the commission of an offence(i) for which, if it were committed, the person who committed it might be arrested without warrant, and(ii) that would be likely to cause immediate and serious injury to the person or property of anyone, or(b)	to prevent anything being done that, on reasonable grounds, he believes would, if it were done, be an offence mentioned in paragraph (a).This Section, therefore, authorizes the use of force to prevent the commission of certain offenses. “Everyone"" would include a police officer. The force must not be more than that which is reasonably necessary. Therefore, an objective test is called for. The Ontario Court of Appeal, in R. v. Scopelliti (1981), 63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 held that the use of deadly force can be justified only in either cases of self-defence or in preventing the commission of a crime likely to cause immediate and serious injury.34(1) 	Self-defence against unprovoked assault - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted without having provoked the assault is justified in repelling force by force if the force he uses is not intended to cause death or grievous bodily harm and is no more than is necessary to enable him to defend himself.(2)	Extent of justification - Everyone who is unlawfully assaulted and who causes death or grievous bodily harm in repelling the assault is justified if(a)	he causes it under reasonable apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm from the violence with which the assault was originally made or with which the assailant pursues his purposes; and(b)	he believes, on reasonable grounds, that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous bodily harm.In order to rely on the defence under subsection (2) of Section 34, a police officer would have to demonstrate that he/she was unlawfully assaulted and caused death or grievous bodily harm to the assaulter in repelling the assault. The police officer must demonstrate that he or she reasonably apprehended that death or grievous bodily harm would result to him or her and that he or she, again on reasonable grounds, believed that he/she could not otherwise preserve himself/herself from death or grievous bodily harm. Again, the use of the term ’reasonable' requires the application of an objective test.Further, the court sets out a number of other legal principles gleaned from the legal precedents cited, including the following:(h) 	Whichever section of theCriminal Codeis used to assess the actions of the police, the Court must consider the level of force that was necessary in light of the circumstances surrounding the event.(i) 	""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". The same applies to the use of force in making an arrest or preventing an escape. Like the driver of a vehicle facing a sudden emergency, the policeman ""cannot be held to a standard of conduct which one sitting in the calmness of a court room later might determine was the best course."" (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).(j) 	Police officers perform an essential function in sometimes difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. The police must not be unduly hampered in the performance of that duty. They must frequently act hurriedly and react to sudden emergencies. Their actions must therefore be considered in the light of the circumstances.(k) 	""It is both unreasonable and unrealistic to impose an obligation on the police to employ only the least amount of force which might successfully achieve their objective. To do so would result in unnecessary danger to themselves and others. They are justified and exempt from liability in these situations if they use no more force than is necessary, having regard to their reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers in which they find themselves"" (Levesque v. Zanibbi et al.).On the basis of the foregoing principles of law then, I must determine:(1)	Whether  theSOreasonably believed that he, orWO#3, was at risk of death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant at the time that he discharged his firearm; and(2)	Whether that belief was objectively reasonable, or, in other words, whether his actions would be considered reasonable by an objective bystander who had all of the information available to theSOat the time that he discharged his firearm.In assessing the actions of theSO, I have taken into account that he was in possession of the following information at the time that he discharged his firearm:Four masked men had just committed a home invasion robbery and the men had been reported as having been observed by the homeowner to be armed with firearms;All four of those men (although later information strongly suggests that there were actually only three robbers) were chased to the BJP School;TheSOobserved four men running to the school, (although one of them was later determined to beCW#3);TheSOwas unaware of the location ofWO#3 at the time that he initially observed the Complainant;The Complainant ignored repeated commands to stop and get on the ground;The parking lot was poorly lit, especially in the area between the school portables and behind the garbage dumpsters;The Complainant had been seen by theSOto remove an object from his waistband, an area of the body which is commonly associated with the location of a firearm, and point it at theSOin a fashion reminiscent of how someone would point a firearm; andTheSOnext observed the Complainant raising his hands and pointing the unknown object atWO#3, again in a fashion similar to how someone would point a firearm.On all of the information theSOhad in his possession at the time he shot and injured the Complainant, I find that theSO, subjectively, had reasonable grounds to believe that his life was at risk from the Complainant and that the Complainant’s actions, as well as the information provided by the dispatcher fromCW#3 that they were in pursuit of armed robbery suspects, would have reasonably caused theSOto believe that the Complainant had a firearm pointed first at theSO, and then atWO#3, and that on each occasion there was a risk of being shot by the Complainant.Additionally, unbeknownst to theSOat the time, a firearm was later located on the school property, on the ground near school portable number 4, the last in the line of portables.I note that the location of this firearm places it in the same location as the Complainant, when he described himself as getting to the end of the portables where he encountered theSO.  I also note that this is the location from which he then ran, claiming that he dropped the bear spray canister.  While the bear spray canister was not located in this location, I note that the discarded firearm was, which causes me to consider the strong probability that theSO,WO#3, andCW#3, actually did observe the Complainant in possession of a firearm, as was their independent belief at the time, which the Complainant then discarded or dropped as he ran away from theSO.  Clearly, as the bear spray was located in the immediate area where the Complainant was hiding, that is not what he dropped as he ran away from theSO.I find further support in this conclusion based on the evidence thatCW#3 advised that prior to the discharge of the first shots by theSO, he observed the Complainant to point an object, which he described as being similar to a firearm but which he also specifically noted was black in colour.  The bear spray canister was red in colour, while the discarded firearm located in the immediate area was indeed black.While this evidence alone may be insufficient to conclusively establish that just prior to theSOfiring upon the Complainant, that the Complainant was pointing a firearm at him, combined with the information already in theSO’s possession at the time that the suspects were armed, I do not doubt that theSOreasonably believed that he was, at that time, facing an armed suspect who had a firearm pointed at him, and later atWO#3, causing him to fear both for his own life and that ofWO#3.While after having repeatedly reviewed all of the evidence, it is still unclear to me whether or not the Complainant was in possession of the firearm later located in the area and had pointed it at theSO, or if he pointed the bear spray canister in a fashion reminiscent of a person pointing a firearm (which I find less likely). I certainly have a strong suspicion that the Complainant did indeed point a firearm at theSO, which I base on the evidence of theSOandCW#3, who observed the Complainant point a black object at theSO, whichCW#3 suspected was a firearm, and the evidence ofWO#3 when he first observed the Complainant pointing something, combined with the later finding of the firearm in that very location.I find it highly probable that when theSOthen discharged his firearm at the Complainant, which would clearly have constituted self-defence pursuant to s. 34 of theCriminal Code, it caused the Complainant to drop his firearm, after which he ran in his continuing efforts to evade the police.  Later, when confronted byWO#3, since he had already dropped his firearm, the Complainant then pulled out the bear repellent canister, which he then kept with him until he hid behind the garbage dumpster, where it was observed by both theSOandWO#3, and later retrieved by investigators.While this evidence may not be sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the Complainant pointed a firearm at theSO(although it might), I find that the evidence, based on the information available to theSOat the time, was sufficient to justify theSOdischarging his firearm.The facts on this record bring to mind the particular dictum as quoted by Justice Power inChartier v. Greavesthat:""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". … (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).Clearly, while I have had the opportunity to review all of the evidence at great length, theSO, ‘in the exigencies of the moment’, did not have the luxury of ‘minutely dissecting the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken’, nor did he have the luxury of waiting to see if the Complainant would discharge a firearm, and thereby risk his own life, as well as that ofWO#3.I find, therefore, on this record, that the evidence satisfies me that the shots that were fired, one of which struck and injured the Complainant, were justified pursuant to s.25 (1) and (3) of theCriminal Codeand that theSO, in preserving himself andWO#3 from death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant, used no more force than was necessary to effect his lawful purpose.As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by theSO, in discharging his firearm at the Complainant, fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and none shall issue.Date:	November 1, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=139

,Toronto Police Service,Armour,Ontario,nNature of Injury/Treatment The Complainant sustained a collapsed right lung three fractures to the ribs on his right side and a non-displaced fracture of the nasal bone,"The search warrant was executed on November 26, 2017, at 6:38 a.m., with a dynamic no knock entry being performed by the Emergency Task Force (ETF), who initially entered and cleared the residence, to ensure the residence was safe for the officers from theGGTFto enter and search.  During the clearing of the residence, three occupants were located in the house, that beingCW#1, the Complainant, andCW#2.  One loaded firearm, a Glock pistol, was also located by theETF, with one round of ammunition in the chamber and eight rounds in the magazine.During the course of the Complainant’s arrest, the subject officers,SO#1 andSO#2 of theETF, used force and during his arrest, the Complainant was injured.  A later assessment at hospital determined that the Complainant had sustained three fractured ribs on his right side, a related collapsed right lung, and a non-displaced nasal bone fracture.  All three of the occupants allege that the officers resorted to an excessive use of force in arresting them.  While only the Complainant sustained a serious injury, his arrest, and the force used to effect that arrest, triggered the mandate of theSIUand the investigation which followed.During the course of the investigation, there were only three civilian witnesses to the incident who were interviewed, those being the three parties arrested inside the residence.  Additionally, the notes of 12 police officers were reviewed, resulting in the interviews of five witness officers who had relevant evidence to offer; the first subject officer,SO#1, also consented to an interview, while the second subject officer,SO#2, did not; neither officer provided their memorandum book notes for review, as was their legal right.There was unfortunately no surveillance video inside the residence, and the police transmissions recordings did not yield any evidence capable of either confirming or denying the allegations of an excessive use of force on the part of the arresting officers.  The evidence of the three occupants of the house, who were arrested, and the arresting police officers, differs in a number of material aspects.The facts that are not in dispute indicate that in the early morning hours of November 26, 2017, members of theETFwere tasked with executing aCriminal Codesearch warrant atCW#1’s residence in the City of Toronto, and the team of nine members, led byWO#6, attended a briefing conducted byWO#11 of theGGTF.  During the briefing, the team was made aware that theGGTFhad information that the residence contained firearms, possibly including two long guns and two handguns, that the residence was known to be used as a ‘stash house’ for firearms, and that gang members in the community were believed to use the residence for that purpose.  Additionally, the team was provided the names of two individuals who might be found in the residence and information that each of those two individuals had extensive criminal records. The area where the residence was located was known for the presence of heavy gang activity.  All of this information was provided and discussed at the briefing.Following the briefing, a tactical meeting was held byWO#6, with his team, in which the potential issues and possible threats posed were discussed and a plan was laid out for theETFentry into the residence, which was to be a dynamic entry because of the belief that the residence was a ‘stash house’ for firearms.  The purpose of a dynamic entry is meant to prevent the residents being given prior notice of the intended entry by police and thereby preventing the residents possibly arming themselves as well as to allow police to take full advantage of the elements of surprise and distraction, in order to allow for a safer entry and containment of the occupants and to prevent a possible loss of life or the opportunity for an armed stand-off.In order to fully take advantage of the elements of surprise and distraction, it was determined that immediately upon breaching the door, a distractionary device (also known as a ‘flash-bang’ orDD) was to be utilized, which would make a very loud and distracting sound and would expel smoke or emit a bright light immediately upon its deployment, thereby causing confusion and prevent any opportunity for the residents to dispose of evidence, escape, or mount a concerted response against police.  Once the door was breached and theDDdeployed, the members of the team were to locate and secure all parties and then turn over the residence to theGGTFinvestigators to execute the search warrant.  The order of entry of the officers on the team was also established.At 6:38 a.m., theETFteam was positioned at the front door of the residence and the breaching team breached the door.  Upon entry,SO#1, who had been designated as number one, meaning he would be the first police officer through the door, loudly and repeatedly announced the presence of police and that they were in possession of a search warrant.  TheDDwas then deployed, delivering a loud bang and a bright light, andSO#1 entered.It is the responsibility of the first officer entering the residence to continue to make clear announcements and commands, whichSO#1 then did.CW#1 was located on the main floor, sleeping on the couch, andSO#1 told her to get down on the floor; other team members then entered and took control ofCW#1.Three or four members of the team then made their way up the stairs, with another officer taking over making announcements about the police presence on the second floor.Once on the second floor,SO#2 held a position covering the upper hallway, andWO#5 stopped behindSO#2 before moving to a closed bedroom door.WO#5 tried to open the door by kicking it, but the door only partially opened.WO#5 then forced his way inside the bedroom.Upon forcing the door open,CW#2 was located crouched behind the door, hiding.  WhileWO#5 was focused onCW#2,WO#6, who was directly behindWO#5, observed the Complainant lying on the top bunk of a bunk bed located against the far wall of the bedroom.WO#6 pointed his pistol at the Complainant and issued loud commands to the Complainant to show his hands; the Complainant was lying on his stomach and his hands were not visible.  The Complainant did not respond toWO#6’s commands, but just lay there looking at him.SO#1 then entered the room and directed his attention to the Complainant, allowingWO#5 andWO#6 to focus onCW#2.WO#5 andWO#6 then grabbed a hold ofCW#2 and dragged him out from behind the door and out into the hallway, during which a black handgun fell to the bedroom floor, possibly having fallen fromCW#2’s waistband.WO#6 immediately yelled, “Gun! Gun! Gun!” to warn his colleagues.WhileWO#5 andWO#6 had been dealing withCW#2,SO#1 had entered the room and moved forward to deal with the Complainant.SO#1 was followed into the room bySO#2.  From this point forward, the version of events as betweenSO#1 and the Complainant diverges greatly.While bothCW#1 andCW#2 allege that the police resorted to an excessive use of force in their individual arrests, neither was in a position to observe the arrest of the Complainant, asCW#1 was still on the first floor, where she had already been arrested, andCW#2 was in the process of being arrested in the hallway outside of the bedroom in which the Complainant was located.According to the Complainant, he was sleeping in his bedroom when he was awoken by loud noises and observedCW#2 sleeping on a rocking chair in his room.  The Complainant also advised that he noticed that there was a small pistol lying on the bed beside him and he assumedCW#2 had placed it there.  The Complainant pushed the pistol off the bed with his arm, as he did not wish to have anything to do with any firearms.The Complainant then observed threeETFofficers enter the bedroom, yelling, “Put your hands up!” and other commands; the Complainant put his hands up.  The Complainant described the three police officers as wearing black masks with only their eyes showing, their uniforms were green, and they were wearing bullet proof vests with “SWAT” written on them.  Clearly, theETFdo not wear uniforms with the word “SWAT” on them, as they are not the “Special Weapons and Tactics” Unit, which is a unit of American police forces and of American television; nor do they wear green uniforms, with theETFuniform being grey in colour with black vests and the uniforms bear theTPSlogo on both the front and back panels.  (A quick review on the internet does indeed confirm that some American SWAT teams wear green uniforms and have the word “SWAT” on the front and back of their vests).The Complainant also described two detectives, and then a third, entering his room at the same time as the three ‘SWAT’ officers; he described these three detectives as being in plainclothes.  This is directly contrary to the evidence of all of the police officers interviewed, bothETFandGGTF, all of whom firmly indicated that theETFofficers were all in their tactical uniforms and that theGGTF, who would not have been inETFuniform, did not enter the residence until after all three occupants had been arrested and the residence was cleared and secured.The Complainant indicated that the ‘SWAT’ officer, now known to have beenSO#1 of theETF, then grabbed onto the Complainant’s left arm and right shoulder and dragged him off the bed to the floor, where he landed on his shoulder and rolled onto his stomach.SO#1 pointed what looked to the Complainant like a pistol, at the Complainant’s head and told the Complainant to shut up and repeatedly told him to put his hands behind his back.  Based on the evidence ofSO#1, the weapon in his possession at the time was an MP5 long gun which required two hands to operate and was on a sling around his body.The Complainant advised that he tried to put his hands behind his back, as directed, but thatSO#1 stomped on him non-stop, with the first blow being to the Complainant’s side and the second to his head, causing his head to hit the floor.The Complainant indicated that he saw the pistol that he had earlier pushed off of his bed lying on the floor nearby, but he did not reach for it.  The Complainant then describedSO#1 stomping on his head about five times, and at one point, kicking him in the groin.  The Complainant could not say whether or not other officers also struck him.  The Complainant indicated that he almost blacked out from the pain, but remained conscious and had difficulty breathing.  He was then handcuffed with his hands behind his back by an unknown police officer and brought to his feet.I note that other than the non-displaced fracture of the nasal bone, the Complainant did not sustain any facial injuries, which appears quite inconsistent with being stomped on his face five times by anETFissued police boot, which one would have expected would have caused much greater damage to the Complainant’s face.  I also note that in addition to the five stomps to his head, the Complainant only indicated one kick to his groin, where no injuries were noted, and one blow to his side.The medical records indicate that the Complainant sustained three rib fractures to his right side and the opinion of the doctor was that his injuries were as consistent with a fall from a height (as in off of the bunk bed) as with a kick or a stomp.  According to the triage records, the nurse noted the following:… per pt (patient) was asleep at home, house got raided and was beat up.  Pt c/o (complains of) R ribs pain.  Bleeding from mouth as well and punched in face.  …The statement ofSO#1 indicated that on November 26, 2017, he was wearing his grey marked tactical outfit with theTPSpolice logo on the front and back panels, heavy body armour, helmet and gloves, and he was equipped with full use of force equipment and was carrying an MP5 long gun which required two hands to operate and was on a sling around his body.AsSO#1 ascended the stairs to the second floor, behind three or four other team members, he heard a particular shout by another officer which indicated that contact had been made with someone inside the residence.  Upon arriving at the top of the stairs, he observedWO#6 andWO#5 in a struggle withCW#2 in the doorway of the first bedroom.  WhileSO#1 approached to assist, his attention was drawn inside the bedroom which was dimly lit and had not yet been cleared.SO#1 observed the Complainant on the top bunk bed with only his face visible, and the remainder of his body under some bedding; the Complainant was watching the struggle to arrestCW#2.SO#1 described the Complainant’s reaction to the police presence as unusual in that while another team member was yelling at the Complainant to put his hands up, the Complainant failed to comply.SO#1 then identified himself as a police officer and again told the Complainant to show his hands with the Complainant still refusing to comply, which causedSO#1 concern.  According toSO#1, had the Complainant shown his hands, the threat level would have been reduced, as that obviously would have confirmed whether or not the Complainant was armed.SO#1 then entered the bedroom alone and continued with commands to the Complainant to show his hands.  Finally the Complainant raised his head and said, “Why?” with whatSO#1 described as defiance.SO#1 noted that the closet inside the bedroom had not yet been cleared, which, along with the Complainant’s refusal to show his hands, raised the threat level considerably inSO#1’s mind.  That concern was further compounded by the fact that the Complainant was still on top of the upper bunk, which gave him an advantage overSO#1, who was standing below.SO#1 advised that one of the disadvantages of carrying an MP5 long gun was that it required two hands to operate, making it difficult to engage with someone physically.SO#1 opined that normally he could have simply covered the Complainant with his firearm and waited for another officer to arrive for backup.  In this case, however, where the closet had not yet been cleared and the Complainant was not showing his hands,SO#1 decided that he could not wait and needed to go ‘hands on’ with the Complainant.SO#1 switched his firearm into safety mode and lowered it, holding it in one hand.  He then stepped forward and used one hand to grab onto the Complainant, around the shoulder area, whereupon the Complainant immediately became actively resistant and pulled away.SO#1 continued to pull the Complainant toward him and off the bed.  When the Complainant’s body was halfway to the floor,SO#1 pushed his body away from him, tucking the Complainant’s head and upper body underneath the top bunk, to avoid the Complainant striking his head on the floor.  The Complainant then landed on the floor, with his shoulder and rib area making contact with the floor.At that point,SO#2 arrived to assist.  The Complainant was being actively resistant andSO#1 was unable to pin him to the floor.  WhileSO#1 described the Complainant as not being assaultive, he was resisting any control thatSO#1 attempted to exert over him.SO#2 then positioned himself on the Complainant’s lower half, whenSO#1 heardWO#6 shout, “Gun! Gun!”SO#1 assessed the situation at that point as escalating from one of active resistance, to one of a threat of serious bodily harm or death, and he immediately scanned the room and saw the black Glock handgun on the floor within arm’s length of the Complainant, who was facing toward the firearm.At that point, considering all of the factors in play,SO#1 feared that he could be shot or forced to shoot the Complainant, if the Complainant was able to get his hands on the firearm.  As a result,SO#1 delivered three knee strikes to the Complainant’s torso and rib area and punched the Complainant in the facial area a number of times in hopes of distracting him from reaching, and possibly using, the firearm. The manoeuvre worked, in that the Complainant reached up to cover his face with his hands, andSO#2 was able to handcuff one of the Complainant’s hands.SO#1 indicated that he would not normally deliver a punch to someone, but in these particular circumstances he felt it was necessary as he felt the situation was escalating and he did not have any other viable option of dealing with the Complainant.Once the Complainant had one hand handcuffed, he pulled his arm away and began to swing and flail his hands around with the handcuff attached.SO#1 continued to direct the Complainant to stop resisting and to give up his hands.  On a scale of one to ten,SO#1 assessed the Complainant’s resistance as falling at a nine.  After another 30 seconds, however, the Complainant was successfully handcuffed.  He was then turned onto his side after complaining that he had trouble breathing andSO#1 observed a little blood on his facial area.SO#1 estimated that the hands on interaction between himself and the Complainant lasted approximately two minutes.AlthoughSO#2 opted not to provide a statement, andWO#5 andWO#6 did not see the actual hands on interaction betweenSO#1 andSO#2 and the Complainant, the evidence of the other officers in the residence was consistent with respect to the outlying facts surrounding the arrest of the Complainant and corroborated the evidence ofSO#1 to that degree.I fully accept that just having been woken from sleep by a dynamic entry into his home by a team ofETFofficers, the Complainant may have been confused as to exactly what occurred.  Based on the injuries sustained, however, as well as the Complainant’s report to medical staff, as recorded in his medical records, that he was “punched in the face”, rather than stomped on his head, I do not accept his evidence that any police officer “stomped” on his head five times, as the obvious result of that type of assault, with anETFissued police boot, would have resulted not only in the nondisplaced nasal bone fracture, which requires fairly little force, but in numerous fractures to many of the bones in the Complainant’s face, with his face being literally crushed by the force and velocity generated by such an extremely violent assault.I also accept, however, that the Complainant was pulled, with force, from the top bunk and landed on the floor, striking his torso on the floor with some force, and that once down, he received several knee strikes to the rib area and a number of closed fisted strikes to the facial area, and that either the fall or the blow caused the rib fractures and related pneumothorax, and the facial blows caused the nondisplaced nasal bone fracture.Having concluded, therefore, that the actions ofSO#1 were the cause of the Complainant’s serious injuries, the only question remaining is whether or not those blows amounted to an excessive use of force in this particular factual situation.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order forSO#1 andSO#2 to qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that they were in the execution of a lawful duty, that they were acting on reasonable grounds, and that they used no more force than was necessary.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear that the police lawfully entered the residence pursuant to a judicially authorized search warrant and were entitled to contain and detain the occupants while the warrant was being executed in order to prevent the disposal or destruction of evidence.Furthermore, once a firearm was located within the bedroom over which the Complainant exercised control, the police officers had reasonable grounds to further arrest the Complainant for possession of an illegal firearm.  As such, both the detention and the arrest of the Complainant were based on reasonable grounds and were pursuant to a lawful duty.  The actions ofSO#1 andSO#2 were therefore legally justified and exempt from prosecution, pursuant to s. 25 (1), as long as they used no more force than was necessary and justified to effect that lawful purpose.In considering the amount of force used by the police officers in apprehending the Complainant, I have considered the direction from the Supreme Court of Canada as set out inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Along the same lines, I have also considered the fulsome review of the case law in this regard, as set out by Justice Power of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Chartier v. Greaves, [2001] O.J. No. 634, as follows:(h) 	Whichever section of theCriminal Codeis used to assess the actions of the police, the Court must consider the level of force that was necessary in light of the circumstances surrounding the event.(i) 	""Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner"". The same applies to the use of force in making an arrest or preventing an escape. Like the driver of a vehicle facing a sudden emergency, the policeman ""cannot be held to a standard of conduct which one sitting in the calmness of a court room later might determine was the best course."" (Foster v. Pawsey) Put another way: It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken. (Berntt v. Vancouver).(j) 	Police officers perform an essential function in sometimes difficult and frequently dangerous circumstances. The police must not be unduly hampered in the performance of that duty. They must frequently act hurriedly and react to sudden emergencies. Their actions must therefore be considered in the light of the circumstances.(k) 	""It is both unreasonable and unrealistic to impose an obligation on the police to employ only the least amount of force which might successfully achieve their objective. To do so would result in unnecessary danger to themselves and others. They are justified and exempt from liability in these situations if they use no more force than is necessary, having regard to their reasonably held assessment of the circumstances and dangers in which they find themselves"" (Levesque v. Zanibbi et al.).Taking into consideration what was undoubtedly a very dynamic and fast-moving situation, I have also considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.Keeping the directions of our courts in mind, then, in considering whether or not an excessive use of force was resorted to in this instance, I have considered the following information that had been provided to theETFprior to entering the residence on November 26, 2017, as follows:This residence was believed to be a ‘stash house’ for firearms, based on information provided by a confidential informant;That same informant had apparently provided information that two long guns and two handguns were in the residence;The residence was believed to be used by gang members;At least two known offenders, with lengthy criminal records, were associated with this residence and were believed to possibly be inside the residence when the entry was made;The residence was in an area known for a significant gang presence and heavy gang activity;The Complainant was refusing to cooperate with directions to show his hands;The Complainant’s hands were hidden from view under the bedding in a house known to contain firearms;A firearm was seen within reach of the Complainant, after he had been removed from the top bunk;Another male (who was one of the individuals with a lengthy criminal record that the police were aware of), who had been hiding behind the door in the Complainant’s bedroom, had already been observed to have a firearm in his waistband, which then fell to the floor;The bedroom was dimly lit, the closet had not yet been cleared, and other police officers were engaged withCW#2, or elsewhere in the residence, leavingSO#1 alone to deal with the Complainant; andOn all of the information provided to theETFin their briefing, this situation was one described as presenting as a high threat level for the potential for death or serious bodily harm.Having considered all of this information, and the situation in whichSO#1 found himself, with a potential that the Complainant, who was not complying with commands to show his hands and who resistedSO#1’s efforts to bring him down from the bunk bed, may be armed, I find thatSO#1’s assessment of the situation as being a high threat level was quite reasonable in the circumstances and that he did not have the luxury, as he might otherwise have done, of simply covering the Complainant with his long gun and waiting for back up in the form of another team member, while the closet was not yet cleared, and the presence of other persons and/or firearms was a real possibility.As such, firstly, I accept thatSO#1 accurately assessed the situation and reacted appropriately when he put the safety on his long gun and entered the room to go “hands on” with the Complainant.  The alternative, of course, of resorting to the use of his long gun, could obviously have had far greater and more lethal consequences for the Complainant.Furthermore, when the Complainant refused to comply with commands to show his hands, and then pulled away fromSO#1,SO#1 was fully justified in pulling the Complainant from the bunk bed and down onto the floor.  While the Complainant may have been injured when he struck the floor, I accept thatSO#1 did whatever possible to prevent the Complainant being injured by his descent, and thatSO#1’s intent when removing the Complainant from the bunk was not to injury him, but simply to contain him and ensure the safety of himself and his fellow officers.Finally, when the warning “Gun! Gun! Gun!” was voiced out byWO#6, andSO#1 observed the firearm within the Complainant’s reach, I can accept, without any reluctance, that the urgency of the situation would have greatly escalated with the risk of loss of life toSO#1 and his colleagues, if not to the other people in the house, if the Complainant was not immediately incapacitated and handcuffed.  As such, despite the serious injuries to the Complainant, in this factual situation, with such risk and potentially fatal consequences, I cannot find the actions ofSO#1 to amount to an excessive use of force on these facts.  As quoted by Justice Power in Chartier v. Grieves, above,“Some allowance must be made for an officer in the exigencies of the moment misjudging the degree of force necessary to restrain a prisoner … It is one thing to have the time in a trial over several days to reconstruct and examine the events which took place on the evening of August 14th. It is another to be a policeman in the middle of an emergency charged with a duty to take action and with precious little time to minutely dissect the significance of the events, or to reflect calmly upon the decisions to be taken.”In conclusion, I find that the actions resorted to bySO#1, and bySO#2, were neither excessive on this particular fact situation, nor do they fall outside of the limits of the criminal law.SO#1 was faced with a situation of extreme urgency, one which he had been trained to deal with, and he dealt with that situation and eliminated the risk that the Complainant continued to pose until he was restrained and the firearm removed from within his reach.  I further note that once the Complainant was handcuffed, no further force was resorted to, nor was there any allegation of any further use of force by the Complainant or anyone else.On this record, I find that the evidence is not sufficient to satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer resorted to an excessive use of force in restraining and arresting the Complainant.  In sum, there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.Date:	October 29, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=133
,Windsor Police Service,Windsor,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment A Computed Tomography CT scan was performed on the Complainant at the hospital which the doctor interpreted as revealing a “questionable undisplaced nasal bone fracture of indeterminate age 2]”,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=76
,Greater Sudbury Police Service,Durham,Ontario,nNature of Injury/Treatment The Complainant was diagnosed with a fractured right jaw mandibular fracture and nasal bone,"The first caller, who appeared to be a young person, advised the 911 call taker that a male cyclist appeared to have fallen off of his bicycle and hit his head.  The caller indicated that the cyclist was claiming that he was struck by a car, but the caller in fact believed that the cyclist had simply crashed on his own, and then fallen and hit his head.  The caller also described the cyclist as being initially unconscious, but then awake, and that he was drunk.  The cyclist was identified as the Complainant.  The caller then indicated that the Complainant was walking away and the caller observed that “he’s drunk so he doesn’t understand. I’m pretty sure he wants to get hit by a car.”  While the line is open, people can be heard trying to assist the Complainant, but at least one of the men indicates “we’re trying to help but he wants to fight us.  He’s being too aggressive.  He’s trying to fight everybody.”The second 911 caller indicated that there is “a guy lying on the side of the road.  Says he just got hit by a car.”As a result of these 911 calls, twoGSPSofficers, the Subject Officer (SO) and Witness Officer (WO) #1, were dispatched to attempt to locate the injured cyclist.At 8:22:17 p.m., the first 911 caller then called again and it was confirmed that the police were on scene.The first 911 caller, a youth, civilian witness (CW) #9, and his brother, observed the Complainant lying on his back in the roadway beside a bicycle.CW#9 observed the Complainant to be bleeding on the right side of his forehead and the blood was running into his eyes.  As the two brothers attempted to assist the Complainant, he accused them of trying to rob him.  The Complainant then tried to punchCW#9’s brother, but missed, following which the Complainant fell two more times.CW#9 then observed the Complainant try to throw himself at a car, but the car had already stopped.  The Complainant was then observed to walk further up the street and into a bush area, from which he jumped into a ditch, where he landed on his head and stomach.Another civilian witness,CW#5, observed the Complainant get up and then fall forward and hit his head on the ice, apparently injuring his forehead.A motorist,CW#8, stopped to assist the Complainant as he lay in the roadway, and observed that the Complainant had blood on his face, mostly on the right side of his forehead, from a cut over his eye. At one point, while attempting to assist the Complainant,CW#8 observed the Complainant throw a punch at another bystander,CW#2, after which the Complainant got up, began yelling and swearing and telling people not to touch him, and kept swinging.CW#8 tried to explain to the Complainant that they were just trying to help him.  This evidence was also consistent with that provided byCW#2.When paramedics arrived at the scene of the first 911 call, they observed the Complainant walking, with a limp, down the street, with blood running around one of his eyes.  The two paramedics,CW#4 andCW#3, then stopped the ambulance beside the Complainant, but he continued to walk away.The paramedics searched for the Complainant, but were unable to locate him.  The police then arrived andCW#4 heardCW#5 tell the police officer that he saw the Complainant walking and that he had slipped on the ice and was unconscious for a period of time; this information causedCW#4 concern that the Complainant had a potential head injury and he asked police to search for the Complainant.CW#1, who was in the area of Beech Street, advised that he had heard a thump, which he believed sounded like somebody’s head hitting the pavement, and saw the Complainant lying on his back by the crosswalk on Beech Street.CW#1 approached the Complainant and observed that he was not moving and that he had foam or saliva coming from his mouth and fresh blood around his swollen right eye and on his hands.CW#1 opined that the Complainant’s injury could not have occurred at that time, because the Complainant had fallen on his back and the injury was above his right eye.CW#1 then observed two police officers arrive and one of the officers, theSO, turned the Complainant onto his left side and began to search his pockets, following which the Complainant began to panic and ‘freak out’, and resisted the officers.CW#1 heard theSOtell the Complainant that he was looking for anything in the Complainant’s pockets that could cause injury.  The Complainant’s arm was then brought behind his back and he yelled that the officer,WO#1, had broken his arm.  He was then handcuffed with his hands behind his back and put onto a stretcher.CW#1 described the actions of the Complainant as being up and down, with periods of calm followed by periods when he would swear at the police officers and tell them to get away from him.CW#1 heard the Complainant say he was going to spit on a police officer, so the officer placed his elbow on the Complainant’s left cheek and pushed his cheek into the stretcher, preventing him from spitting on anyone.  The Complainant was then put into the back of the ambulance.CW#1 never saw anyone strike the Complainant.Within five to ten minutes after the police had gone in search of the Complainant,CW#4 received information that the Complainant had now been located on Beech Street at Durham Street and paramedics attended that location.  Upon arrival,CW#4 observed theSOandWO#1 asking the Complainant if he had any weapons and that they would search him for weapons, at which point the Complainant became agitated and refused to identify himself or to allow police to search him.  The Complainant also refused to allow the paramedics to assess and treat him.CW#4 indicated that he was concerned that the Complainant was experiencing an ultra-level of consciousness, which he attributed to either a possible head injury or the consumption of drugs.CW#4 indicated that for these reasons he felt it was important that the Complainant be assessed at hospital.CW#4 observed the Complainant to then become violent, belligerent, and uncooperative, as he tried to prevent police searching him.  The two police officers then took the Complainant face down onto the street, where the Complainant continued to struggle as he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back.CW#4 indicated that the Complainant was angry because he believed thatWO#1 had injured his shoulder during the handcuffing process.  The Complainant remained uncooperative as he was placed onto the stretcher and he had to be secured with three belts, two on his legs and one around his waist, tying him to the stretcher.  The Complainant continuously asked that the handcuffs be removed in order that he could fightWO#1.Once the Complainant was placed inside the back of the ambulance, he continued to wiggle and was able to pull his legs out from under the bottom two straps, following which he kicked wildly at the defibrillator monitor, which was mounted on a metal stand above the Complainant’s feet.  According to theSO, he believed that the Complainant was actually trying to kick him, but the monitor got in his way.  The Complainant continued to kick the monitor until it broke off its base and hit the rear door, landing at the feet of theSO.CW#4 indicated that he was concerned that the Complainant was going to hurt either himself and/or theSOif he continued to kick wildly, as he had been doing.CW#4 described theSOas then stepping forward, in a very calm manner, placing his left hand on the Complainant’s chest and delivering two short jabs/punches to the left side of the Complainant’s chin and jaw area.  The Complainant then immediately calmed down and began to cry, complaining that theSOhad broken his jaw.CW#4 indicated that he thought that it was possible that the Complainant’s jaw had been broken, but he continued to speak and his speech pattern did not change.CW#4 indicated that theSOtold him that he struck the Complainant to settle him down and prevent him causing any further damage.CW#4 advised that, in his view, the actions of theSOwere appropriate and justified in the circumstances.Once at the hospital, the Complainant remained belligerent andCW#4 heard him indicate that he wanted to fight the police again and he threatened to spit on the police officers.The above version of events, as compiled from the interviews of all of the civilian witnesses, is consistent with that provided by theSOin his written statement, and byWO#1 in his interview.Additionally,WO#2 advised that once at hospital, theSOdisclosed to him that when the Complainant awoke in the street, he refused to identify himself and became agitated, aggressive, and combative towards theSOandWO#1, spitting at them.  The Complainant was then arrested for being intoxicated in a public place, contrary to theLiquor Licence Act, and handcuffed.  TheSOtoldWO#2 that once the Complainant was inside the ambulance, he kicked the defibrillator mount and the defibrillator fell to the floor, as a result of which theSOpunched the Complainant once in the mouth area, to de-escalate his behaviour.Following the Complainant’s initial visit to hospital, he was released back into police custody at 9:37 p.m., after refusing medical treatment or assessment.  He was then transported by police to the police station; en route, he began to kick at the windows and his feet had to be hobbled by a restraint system.  Once at the police station, when the Complainant was observed to again apparently lose consciousness and was sweating and frothing at the mouth,EMSwas again called and he was transported to the hospital a second time.Eventually, at 8:22 a.m. the following morning, the Complainant was assessed at the hospital, his jaw was X-rayed, and it was determined that he had a mandibular fracture to the right side of his jaw and nasal bone.  The Complainant subsequently required surgery because his teeth were not lining up properly, braces were put on both his upper and lower teeth, and his jaw was wired shut.  The doctor who performed the surgery indicated that the Complainant’s prognosis was good and his jaw is expected to heal properly.The Complainant himself had little accurate recall of the events.  He conceded that he had consumed both a bottle of gin and smoked marijuana prior to waking up in the middle of the road being poked and jabbed by two police officers.  The Complainant recalled that a police officer poked his finger in behind the Complainant’s right ear, between his jaw and his neck, which he attributed to possibly having broken his jaw, but he was unsure.  The Complainant also believed that he had either been hit by a car or fell off his bicycle, and he recalled a cut over his right eye and some scrapes.The Complainant did recall being handcuffed and placed inside an ambulance and taken to the hospital, and agreed that he was so mad that he kicked the defibrillator in the ambulance.The Complainant had no recollection of being struck by theSOin the ambulance, instead recalling that once at the hospital, when he was handcuffed to the bed, he spit in the face of one of the police officers, whereupon he was warned that he would be hurt if he spit on the officers again.  The Complainant recalled then spitting in the officer’s face again, after which a spit mask was put on his face and he was punched in the face by one of the police officers.  The Complainant opined that, alternatively, this may have been when his jaw was broken.On all of the evidence, it is difficult to determine exactly when the Complainant was injured, with the possibilities ranging between his possibly being hit by a car, his numerous falls onto the icy ground, with at least one fall causing an injury to the right side of his face as evidenced by the cut and bleeding to the area above his right eye, his throwing himself at a car, his throwing himself into the ditch, the one or two jabs/punches to the Complainant’s left side jaw area by theSOin the ambulance, or anything that may have occurred prior to his coming to the attention of the civilian witnesses, police, and paramedics who tried to assist him.While the Complainant has some limited recollection of events from the afternoon and evening of November 23, he apparently cannot recall if he was struck by a car or simply fell off his bicycle, he is mistaken as to which officer rode in the ambulance with him, he attributed a police officer poking him behind his ear between his neck and his jaw as possibly fracturing his jaw, which was not seen by any of the many civilian and paramedic witnesses who were present during the Complainant’s arrest, or when he was punched by theSOafter he spit in the officer’s face on two occasions in the hospital.  I note that this last recollection, of being punched in the face in the hospital, is contradicted by all of the other witnesses who were present at that time, including the paramedics and other police officers.The fact that the Complainant believed that his jaw was possibly already broken when he was poked by a police officer on Beech Street causes me to believe that he was already experiencing jaw pain early on in the events of the evening.  Therefore, while the Complainant again experienced pain when he was punched by theSO, withCW#4 hearing him indicate at that time that he thought his jaw was broken, the fact thatCW#4 noticed no change in the Complainant’s speech or his ability to speak, makes it less clear if theSOactually caused his injury, or if the jab to the left side of the Complainant’s jaw simply again made him aware of the pain that he had already experienced earlier on.Additionally, while both theSOandCW#4 indicated that theSOstruck the Complainant on the left side of his face, and the mandibular fracture was on the right side of his face, I note that the waters are further muddied by the fact that the Complainant clearly already had an injury to the right side of his face prior to the police arrival.I also note that the doctor who performed the Complainant’s surgery indicated that the trauma which caused the right side fracture to the Complainant’s jaw need not have necessarily been delivered in that location, with the only requirement being force of some kind, not necessarily over the fracture site.  The doctor indicated that the further from the fracture site that the force was applied, the less force that would be required to cause the fracture, as the jawbone has a lever mechanism.  The doctor also opined that this type of injury is most commonly seen in people who have fallen on the stairs or when shoveling snow, but could also be consistent with being punched.When directly asked if a punch to the left jaw could have caused a fracture to the right side of the jaw, the doctor indicated it was possible, but had that been the case, he would have expected there to have been a secondary fracture.Based on all of the evidence then, it appears that the Complainant most likely received his injury when he fell, either when he fell off of his bicycle onto the icy ground, at which time he also injured the upper right side of his face, as was observed by all of the civilian witnesses prior to the arrival of either police or ambulance, or when (if) he was struck by a car, or when he threw himself at a car, or when he threw himself into the ditch landing on his head and stomach, or any of the many times that he fell, both when observed by the civilian witnesses, or on any prior occasion when no one was present.Clearly, the opportunities for injury, when a man who is both intoxicated and under the influence of marijuana, and is riding his bicycle on icy streets, are endless.  While the doctor indicated that the injury could also possibly be attributable to a punch to the left side of the jaw, in the absence of the secondary fracture referred to by the doctor, it appears that this is far less likely than that the injury was caused by a fall.On this record, I find that the evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant received his injury when he was punched on the opposite side of the face by theSO, in the ambulance.  If, however, that was the cause of his fracture, I take the expert opinion of the surgeon to be that the amount of force used by theSOwas far less, because of the distance between the fracture site and where the blow was delivered, than what would have been required to fracture the jaw with a direct blow.  As such, if theSOdid cause the fracture, I accept that he did not use an excessive amount of force to do so.Whether or not the blow or blows delivered by theSOcaused the Complainant’s serious injury, however, I must still assess his actions to determine whether or not the delivery of the one to two quick jabs/punches to the Complainant amounted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order for theSOto qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from the observations of all the witnesses present, civilian, paramedic, and police, that the Complainant was intoxicated in a public place and therefore in violation of s. 31 (4) of theLiquor Licence Actand was arrestable as such.  It is further clear that the Complainant was not capable of caring for himself and could not simply be left in the street, injured and on occasion unconscious, simply because he refused to be assessed or assisted by paramedics and police.  As such, while theSOclearly had reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was intoxicated in a public place, he was acting within his lawful duties and on reasonable grounds when he placed the Complainant under arrest.Once in the custody of police, it was further incumbent upon them to ensure that he obtained whatever medical treatment he required.  As such, both the arrest and the Complainant’s subsequently being placed inside an ambulance to be taken for medical treatment, were legally justified.With respect to the amount of force used in relation to the Complainant, I accept on all of the evidence, and despite the Complainant’s assertion otherwise, that the only force used was the force required to handcuff the Complainant at the scene and secure him to the stretcher, and later, in the ambulance, the one or two quick jabs/punches to the left side of the Complainant’s face after he kicked the defibrillator monitor, smashing it from its mooring, and he continued to kick wildly thereafter.  I accept on the evidence ofCW#4 that, in the confined space in the back of the ambulance, in which all three men found themselves, that were the Complainant allowed to continue with his wild and unruly behaviour, that there was a great risk that either the Complainant, or theSO, or both, would be injured.I accept, based on the evidence ofCW#4, which was fully consistent with the evidence of theSO, that after the delivery of the one or two quick jabs, which caused the Complainant to stop kicking and fighting, no further force was used by theSO.I have also taken into considerationCW#4’s observations that theSOwas neither angry, nor acting in retaliation, when he calmly approached and delivered the one or two quick jabs.  From this evidence, I accept that theSOwas neither being vindictive nor vengeful, but was simply and calmly doing his job, which required him to stop the Complainant causing any further injury to himself or others.On these facts, despite the fact that the Complainant was handcuffed to the stretcher at the time, I find that I must agree with the assessment ofCW#4 that the actions of theSOwere both justified and appropriate in order to eliminate the risk that the Complainant continued to pose to all three men if he was not forced to discontinue his violent and unruly behaviour.  On this basis, even were I to find that theSOcaused the injury to the Complainant, of which I am not satisfied on this evidence, I cannot find his actions to amount to an excessive use of force in these circumstances.Based on these facts, then, despite the unfortunate injury sustained by the Complainant, I cannot find the actions of theSOto be any more than what was necessary and justified in the circumstances.  In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety. On this record, it is clear that the force used by theSOwas the only viable option open to him to prevent the Complainant continuing with his violent behaviour and possibly causing further harm or property damage.  Had the Complainant not acted out in the fashion that he did, there would have been no need for theSOto use force in order to stop the Complainant’s violent actions and calm the situation.In conclusion, on all of the reliable evidence before me, I find that the evidence does not satisfy me either that theSO’s actions were the cause of the Complainant’s injuries or that his actions fell outside of the limits of the criminal law, and I am therefore left without the grounds to lay criminal charges and none shall issue.Date: October 23, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=129
,Halton Regional Police Service,Burlington,Ontario,nNature of Injury/Treatment The Complainant sustained a minimally displaced comminuted impacted fracture of the surgical neck of the left proximal humerus the long bone in the upper arm extending from the shoulder to the elbow,"As a result of the call, the Subject Officer (SO) and Witness Officer (WO) #1 were dispatched to the bank, arriving at 9:51 a.m. Shortly thereafter, the male person at the bank, the Complainant, was apprehended and arrested.  During his arrest, the Complainant was injured and he was transported to hospital where he was assessed and it was discovered that he had sustained a minimally displaced comminuted fracture to the neck of the left proximal humerus (the long bone that runs from the shoulder to the elbow).During the course of this investigation, in addition to the Complainant, an off duty special constable, who was coincidentally just entering the bank on personal business as the Complainant was exiting, and Civilian Witness (CW) #1, were interviewed, as was the doctor who assessed the Complainant.  In addition,SIUInvestigators located and reviewed Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage which captured the arrest of the Complainant. There is very little dispute as to the facts.As theSOandWO#1 entered theRBCto investigate the call that had been received as to the suspicious behaviour of the Complainant, the Complainant spotted them and decided to leave the bank.  As he attempted to leave,CW#1 stopped him and both officers asked him to accompany them into an office in the bank to have a chat.  Despite not specifically advising the Complainant why they wished to speak with him, the Complainant acknowledges that he had a fairly good idea.  One of the police officers put a hand on his elbow to guide the Complainant into the office.As they walked toward the office,CW#1 was slightly behind and theSOslightly ahead, of the Complainant.  When the Complainant saw his opportunity, he decided to run and he ran toward the bank exit doors, where, coincidentally, Police employee Witness (PEW) #1, who was off duty at the time and attending the bank for personal business, was just entering.PEW#1, because he was just entering, was blocking the doorway and the Complainant then tried to exit through another door on the right, but it was locked, further delaying the Complainant’s exit, allowing police to close the gap between themselves and the Complainant.As the Complainant was exiting through the door, he was aware that one of the officers was grabbing for him.Once out of the bank vestibule, the Complainant turned to the right with both police officers right behind him.  After running about 30 feet, theSOreached out and grabbed the Complainant around the waist, in a bear hug type manoeuvre, and they both fell to the pavement, with theSOlanding on top of the Complainant.  The Complainant believed that he may have put out his left arm to break his fall.Once on the ground, on his stomach, theSO, who was on the Complainant’s back, grabbed his left arm and pulled it behind his back for handcuffing.  The Complainant only first felt pain in his left arm when theSOgrabbed his arm, and the Complainant believed that this was the cause of his injury.  The medical evidence, however, confirmed that the injury to the Complainant’s left arm was not consistent with the arm having been pulled back by theSO, but would have been caused by the fall or from hitting the humerus on something solid, like the pavement.  The doctor emphasized that the injury was definitely not as a result of being beaten or from being torn or twisted, as the fracture pattern would have presented differently, but was caused from blunt force trauma on a hard immoveable surface, like the sidewalk.On the evidence, then, there can be no dispute that the injury sustained by the Complainant was as result of his striking the pavement with his arm when he was grabbed and taken to the ground by theSO.  The only question remaining to be determined then is whether or not the officer’s “tackle” of the Complainant amounted to an excessive use of force on the part of theSO.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Code, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  As such, in order for theSOto qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that he was in the execution of a lawful duty, that he was acting on reasonable grounds, and that he used no more force than was necessary.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from the information provided by theRBCin the telephone call, and later to the police upon their arrival at the bank, that they had reasonable grounds to stop and investigate the Complainant for a suspected fraud in progress. While they lacked sufficient grounds to actually arrest the Complainant based only on the suspicions of the bank employees, they certainly had sufficient grounds to detain and investigate the Complainant.  When the Complainant then ran from the police, it would have strengthened those suspicions and given police further reasonable grounds.As such, the initial actions of police in attempting to investigate the Complainant were lawful and reasonable.  After he then ran from police, they had reasonable grounds to pursue and stop the Complainant and to place him under arrest for fraud.  Therefore, pursuant to the requirements of s. 25 (1), as the police were in the execution of a lawful duty and they were acting on reasonable grounds, they are exempt from prosecution as long as they used no more force than was necessary to effect that lawful purpose.There is no dispute, on all of the evidence, and as confirmed by theCCTVfootage, that the only force used by theSOto apprehend the Complainant was to grab him around the waist in a bear hug and take him to the ground; there being no other force used once he had been stopped, other than pulling his hands behind his back for handcuffing.  It is equally clear that the Complainant left the police officers no other options when he chose to run from them and that it was incumbent upon police, having received a fraud complaint, to stop and investigate the Complainant on that complaint.Based on these facts, then, despite the unfortunate injury sustained by the Complainant, I cannot find the actions of theSOto be any more than what was necessary and justified in the circumstances.  In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude.

C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety. On this record, it is clear that the force used by theSOin stopping the Complainant was the only viable option open to him to prevent the Complainant’s escape.  Had the Complainant not chosen to attempt to flee in order to evade police, there would have been no need for theSOto forcefully stop him, and he would never have been injured.  On these facts, I find that it was the Complainant’s own actions which unfortunately caused him to be injured.In conclusion, on the facts before me, which are not disputed in any significant way and which are fully confirmed by theCCTVfootage, I do not find that the evidence is sufficient to satisfy me, on reasonable grounds, that theSO’s actions were in any way excessive, nor is there any basis for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.Date:	October 16, 2018Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=100
,Niagara Regional Police Service,Mississauga,Ontario,CW 1 was examined and released with no serious injuries from the motor vehicle collision,"Once the Complainant was alone in his motor vehicle, he was approached with lights and sirens activated, following which he pulled over to the side of the road on Welland Avenue near Water Street in the City of St. Catharines.  Two uniformed and two plainclothes police officers dressed in suits approached the Complainant’s motor vehicle.  None of the officers had any use of force options in hand, as it was not expected that the Complainant, based on his criminal history, would be either assaultive or resistant.WO#3 approached the Complainant’s motor vehicle on the driver’s side and put hisNRPSbadge up against the window, identifying himself as a police officer, and ordered the Complainant to shut off his car and open the door.WO#3 then tried to open the door, but it was locked.  BeforeWO#3 was able to advise the Complainant that he was under arrest, the Complainant sped away.Immediately upon the Complainant speeding off,WO#5 radioed and advised allSCUofficers involved that they were not to pursue the motor vehicle, but instead, officers were dispatched to various locations where the Complainant was known to frequent, in further attempts to locate and arrest him.  Because of the radio band used by theSCU, these communications were neither recorded nor were they heard by uniformed officers not involved in the attempted arrest of the Complainant.Following the failed arrest, however,WO#7 contacted dispatch and provided the following information, which would have been heard by all police officers on the regular band:WO#7:Need a uniform car on Geneva.  There’s a vehicle northbound; it’s being operated by (the Complainant), he’s a 10-63 (confirmed) for a robbery.DISPATCH:Sorry, it’s being operated by who?WO#7:(the Complainant).DISPATCH:10-4.  Are you in pursuit of that vehicle?WO#7:Negative.  We’re just trying to catch up to him.DISPATCH:10-4.WO#7:(inaudible)WO#7:Last saw him Niagara and Church Street.DISPATCH:Niagara and Church, 10-4.WO#7:Street Crime can help you with that.  It’s a blue Ford Fiesta hatchback and the licence plate is (redacted), a good chance they may be heading back towards (address redacted), South Queenston and Canals Parkway.DISPATCH:Blue Ford Fiesta hatchback, marker (redacted), comes back on a 2014 Ford Blue, registered to a (name and address of registered owner redacted).WO#7:10-4.  So, the driver is (the Complainant), he’s wanted for robbery, theft	times two, now flight and dangerous.TheSO, theNRPSK-9 officer, having heard this communication over the police radio, then responded as follows:TheSO:K9, I’m behind that vehicle, Bunting.DISPATCH:K9 is behind the vehicle on Bunting.DISPATCH:Code 5.  All units, Code 5.TheSO:K9, pursuit.DISPATCH:All units, Code 5.  K9’s in pursuit of the vehicle, northbound on Bunting.TheSO:Approaching Welland, speeds are 120.DISPATCH:Speeds 120, use cau ---TheSO:Okay, he wrecked out, he wrecked out; right in front of Popeye’s.  I need a 52 (ambulance), he’s still northbound just past Roehampton, he’s got a flat tire.DISPATCH:In front of Popeye’s, 10-4.  Still northbound, has – has a flat tire.  …TheSO:We’re on Hawthorne and Glenellen.DISPATCH:Hawthorne and Glenellen.TheSO:52-4.Unknown Officer:So, he hit another car in front of the ministry.Unknown Officer:Everybody else, what’s the speed still?DISPATCH:K9, your speeds?TheSO:I’m on Bunting, foot pursuit.  I’ve got him apprehended right now on the ground.While only two civilian witnesses came forward to be interviewed by theSIUinvestigators, of those, the first only observed the incident wherein theSCUhad originally attempted to apprehend the Complainant before he fled, and the second was the driver of the motor vehicle with which the Complainant collided on Bunting Road.CW#1 advised that he was travelling southbound on Bunting Road towards Welland Avenue in St. Catharines at approximately 1:30 to 2:40 p.m. on November 16, 2017; he described the roads as dry and asphalt, and traffic as moderate.CW#1 heard a siren and observed a police vehicle coming northbound towards him.  As the police vehicle approached the intersection of Bunting Road and Welland Avenue, with its lights flashing,CW#1 pulled over to the right side of Bunting Road and stopped.Simultaneously, a large delivery type truck was also travelling northbound on Bunting Road and signaled to make a left turn into the Walmart parking lot.CW#1 only first saw the blue Ford Fiesta, which was also travelling northbound, when it was already within four to five feet ofCW#1’s vehicle, as the delivery truck had obstructed his view of the car until the car passed the delivery truck on the driver’s side.  The blue car was travelling at a high rate of speed, whichCW#1 estimated to be approximately 100 to 120 km/h, then struck the southbound curb in front ofCW#1’s vehicle, before colliding with the driver’s side of the front ofCW#1’s vehicle.  The Ford Fiesta then continued on, leaving the scene.When the delivery truck completed its left turn,CW#1 observed the police vehicle pass by the rear of the truck.CW#1 estimated that the police vehicle was approximately 15 to 20 feet behind the blue car at that point.While neither the Complainant or theSOmade themselves available to be interviewed bySIUinvestigators, and the only civilian witness,CW#1, had only a very brief and limited observation of the police pursuit, there is no evidence as to the driving of theSOduring his pursuit of the Complainant, other than that contained in his own notes and as revealed in the police communications recording.TheSO, in his notes, indicated that he heard theBOLO(Be-On-Look-Out) over the police radio at 2:23 p.m. from the Criminal Investigations Unit (presumablyWO#7) describing a blue Ford Fiesta and its driver, who was wanted for robbery.  This is confirmed by the radio communications recording, as reproduced above.  As also confirmed in the recording, theSO’s notes indicate that no information was provided as to when the robbery had occurred or if there were weapons involved.TheSOnoted that he heard dispatch provide the address on Bunting Road for the registered owner of the suspect motor vehicle, and he turned onto Bunting Road to look for the car.  TheSOnoted that as he approached the intersection of Bunting Road and Eastchester Avenue, he observed a blue Ford Fiesta, which he believed to be the suspect vehicle, facing eastbound on Eastchester a few cars back from the red light at the intersection.At 2:24 p.m., theSOturned onto Eastchester Avenue to confirm the licence plate on the vehicle when he observed the Fiesta proceed around the vehicles in front of him, turn left against the red light, and accelerate away. TheSOwas able to confirm that the licence plate on the Fiesta matched the vehicle being sought.  TheSO, who was operating a fully marked police vehicle with his service dog inside, then made a U-turn and activated his emergency roof lights and siren. TheSOnoted that he observed the Fiesta weaving from the right to the left lane, passing other motorists.  TheSOestimated that the Fiesta was a few hundred yards ahead of him.TheSO’s notes indicate that he advised dispatch that his speeds were 120 km/h when he was a few hundred metres from Welland Avenue; he estimated the speeds of the Fiesta in the range of 80 to 90 km/h.  TheSOindicated that he was driving at a greater speed than the Fiesta in order to close the gap and initiate a traffic stop.This evidence is confirmed both by the communications recordings and the analysis of theNRPSdetailed call summary which places the average speed of the police cruiser at 125.4 km/h during the 2.09 km duration of the pursuit.TheSOhas noted that he considered the time of day, the location, the moderately high volume of vehicle traffic, and the speed of the Ford Fiesta, in determining that the potential hazards of a police pursuit outweighed the necessity of stopping the Fiesta, and he made the decision to abort the pursuit prior to his arriving at the intersection of Bunting Road and Welland Street.Having made the decision to abort, theSOthen slowed his speed but kept his emergency lighting system and siren activated in order to warn pedestrians and other motorists of the potential hazard posed by the subject vehicle.  At that time, theSOattempted to get on the radio to notify the dispatcher that he had aborted the pursuit, but was unable to do so due to the high volume of radio traffic.At 2:25 p.m., theSOhas noted that he slowed down as he saw a white cube truck, travelling northbound on Bunting Road, initiate a left turn into the parking lot and observed that the Ford Fiesta was trying to pass the truck on the left side.  TheSOsurmised that a collision was likely to ensue between the driver’s side of the truck and the Ford.  This evidence, with respect to the white truck and the Ford Fiesta’s movements, appears consistent with the evidence ofCW#1.TheSOnoted that he then accelerated again, in anticipation of the collision and the likelihood that the driver of the Ford would then flee on foot, in which case he wanted to arrest the driver before he had the opportunity to flee.  TheSOalso surmised that he was in a good position to make an arrest, as he had his service dog with him.TheSOobserved the Fiesta apply its brakes and then make a sudden left turn to avoid colliding with the truck, resulting in the Fiesta entering the southbound lanes of traffic and colliding withCW#1’s motor vehicle, which was stopped in the southbound lanes of Bunting Road.TheSOobserved the Fiesta to come almost to a complete stop and that its front driver’s side tire had deflated.  TheSOthen immediately contacted dispatch and advised them of the collision and that an ambulance was required.This transmission can be heard on the communications recording.TheSO, as he was preparing to exit his vehicle, then saw the Fiesta begin to drive away northbound on Bunting Road, despite its front end damage and the fact that it was now driving on the wheel rim.TheSOnoted in his memorandum book that he then considered that the Fiesta would not be able to travel far in this condition, that its speed would be slow due to the damage, and that when it finally became fully inoperable, the driver would flee the scene on foot.  He also considered the urgency to apprehend the driver, in the interests of public safety, and that it was still undetermined whether or not the driver was in possession of any weapons, possibly firearms, which had been used during the robbery.  Taking all of these factors into account, theSOnoted that he determined that his best course of action was to re-engage in a vehicular pursuit, which he then did.TheSO, now directly behind the Fiesta, followed it to Glenellen Drive, where it travelled onto a front lawn near the intersection with Gormley Crescent, then regained control and continued northbound on Glenellen Drive for another approximately 50 metres, while theSOfollowed with lights and sirens.  He then observed the Fiesta fail to negotiate a turn and drive up onto the front lawn of a residence, where it came to rest.TheSOthen pulled his police cruiser alongside the passenger side of the Ford Fiesta and exited his cruiser yelling the police challenge, “Police K-9! You’re under arrest! Stop running or I will send my dog.”When the driver, the Complainant, continued to run, theSOopened the rear door of his cruiser while simultaneously again yelling out the K-9 challenge, before then releasing the dog and directing it to, “take him”, meaning to apprehend the Complainant, who had refused to stop running.TheSOindicated that he deployed his service dog for a number of reasons, including that the Complainant already had a good head start on him and he was not confident that he would be able to catch up to him on his own, that the Complainant could possibly still be in possession of whatever weapons he had used during the robbery which would put theSOat unnecessary risk, and that the dog would be able to apprehend the Complainant “faster, safer, and more effectively.”  TheSOcontinued to yell at the Complainant to stop, as the dog was pursuing him, but the Complainant refused to do so.The dog then engaged the Complainant by biting him on the right lower leg and holding him, immediately taking the Complainant to the ground, where he held the Complainant until theSOcaught up.  TheSOestimated that the dog engaged the Complainant for about three seconds, when theSOarrived and placed his hands on the Complainant’s back and told him to lay down on the ground with his arms spread out.  TheSOcommanded the dog to release and he then stood back with the dog.  He indicated that he did not wish to leave the dog engaged (i.e. biting the Complainant’s leg) because the Complainant appeared to be compliant at that point, and it would have caused further injury to the Complainant.TheSOnoted that he was unable to handcuff the Complainant at that time, as he was hands on with his dog in order to control it, but he continued to direct the Complainant to stay down and not to move.  TheSOnoted that he then called in to dispatch on his radio and advised of his location in order that back-up attend and assist in handcuffing the Complainant.  This is confirmed by the communications recording.When the Complainant, however, insisted on getting to his knees, despite the commands to stay down, theSOfeared that the Complainant would either try to run or could pull a weapon, and as a result, theSOthen drew his firearm and pointed it at the Complainant, warning him that if he did not lie down, theSOwould again send his dog to bite him.  When the Complainant continued to try to get to his feet to stand, theSOagain directed the dog to engage the Complainant, and it again bit him on the lower right leg, at which point the Complainant went back to the ground and theSOimmediately had the dog disengage.  TheSOindicated that on this occasion the dog had engaged the Complainant for one second before theSOgave him the police dog command to let go.Immediately thereafter, a second officer arrived and handcuffed the Complainant, taking control of him while theSOreturned the dog to his cruiser.  Once theSOdetermined that the Complainant had been injured, he summoned an ambulance to assist, as he had at the previous accident scene.WO#5 stated that theSOhad relayed to him, following the arrest of the Complainant, the sequence of events leading up to the arrest; the sequence provided toWO#5, and relayed to theSIU, is consistent with the version in theSO’s notes.AnalysisIn coming to my decision with respect to this matter, I have divided the actions of theSOinto two distinct areas:  the vehicle pursuit, and the dog bites.  While technically the vehicle pursuit, which caused neither the Complainant norCW#1 serious injury, would not trigger the mandate of theSIU, as the dog bites did produce serious injury and an investigation was launched, I feel it necessary to address both areas in this decision.The PursuitIn hindsight, and having reviewed all of the evidence in this matter, and not just the information available to theSOat the time that he engaged the Complainant in a police pursuit, I accept that based on the limited information provided in the radio dispatch, that theSOcould reasonably have been unaware that theSCUofficers were executing outstanding warrants against the Complainant, as opposed to being in hot pursuit of a robber, possibly armed and in possession of evidence of the robbery, who was fleeing from a robbery that may have just occurred and for which he may still be in possession of a weapon, possibly a firearm, which was used to execute the robbery.Furthermore, I find that it is unclear from the dispatch whether or not the suspect had been fully identified, which would have alleviated the need for a police pursuit.[1]While there were no witnesses to the pursuit other thanCW#1, whose observations were limited and very brief, the only evidence as to the majority of the pursuit comes from theSOhimself, either by way of his notes, the information he relayed by way of the communications recording, or the information he provided toWO#5 after the fact.On the record as I have it, then, there is no evidence that the driving of theSOat any time interfered with any other motorists and/or pedestrians, that he disobeyed anyHighway Traffic Actprovisions, other than by his rate of speed, or that his driving was in any way dangerous to other users of the roadway.Additionally, the evidence fromCW#1 was that the roads were dry asphalt and the traffic was moderate; the photos taken of the collision scenes indicate that the roads appeared to be in good condition and the weather was clear; and, the information from theNRPSDetailed Call Summary determined that the duration of the pursuit was 61 seconds and covered some 2.09 kilometres, with an average speed determined at 125.4 km/h in an un-posted 50 km/h zone.I further note that examination of the pursuit route concluded that a large majority of the route covered consisted of vacant lots, parking lots, and industrial and commercial businesses, with only the last portion, approaching Gormley Crescent to Glenellen Drive, appearing to be residential.There is no dispute that theSOwas involved in a police pursuit with the Ford Fiesta being operated by the Complainant; however, the communications recording confirms that theSOwas in compliance with the OntarioPolice Services Actlegislation in that he immediately notified the dispatcher that he was in a vehicular pursuit, that he continued to update the dispatcher as to his location and the speeds at which he was travelling, he notified the dispatcher of the collision withCW#1’s motor vehicle on Bunting Road, and the final resting place of the Complainant’s motor vehicle, as well as calling for ambulance services to assist on each occasion.Furthermore, as indicated above, I have concluded, based on the information as contained in the communications recording, that theSOmight reasonably have believed that “a criminal offence has been committed” pursuant to s. 2 (1) (a) of the relevant legislation.Pursuant to Ontario Regulation 266/10 of the OntarioPolice Services Actentitled Suspect Apprehension Pursuits, s. 2(1):A police officer may pursue, or continue to pursue, a fleeing motor vehicle that fails to stop,(a)	If the police officer has reason to believe thata criminal offence has been committedor is about to be committed; or(b)	For the purposes of motor vehicle identification or the identification of an individual in the vehicle.(2) Before initiating a suspect apprehension pursuit,a police officer shall determine that there are no alternatives available….(3) A police officer shall, before initiating a suspect apprehension pursuit, determine whether in order to protect public safety the immediate need to apprehend an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle or the need to identify the fleeing motor vehicle or an individual in the fleeing motor vehicleoutweighs the risk to public safety that may result from the pursuit.(4) During a suspect apprehension pursuit, a police officer shall continually reassess the determination made under subsection (3) andshall discontinue the pursuit when the risk to public safety that may result from the pursuit outweighs the risk to public safety that may result if an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle is not immediately apprehendedor if the fleeing motor vehicle or an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle is not identified.Furthermore, based on the information contained in theSO’s notes, it appears, pursuant to s. 2 (4), that theSOdid reassess his decision to engage in a pursuit and decided to terminate when he considered the factors and decided that “the risk to public safety that may result from the pursuit outweighs the risk to public safety that may result if an individual in the fleeing motor vehicle is not immediately apprehended,” as he indicated that he had done when he decided to abort the pursuit prior to his arrival at the intersection of Bunting Road and Eastchester Avenue, just as the Ford Fiesta collided withCW#1’s motor vehicle.While theSOdid re-engage in a vehicle pursuit after the collision, I note that he only did so because he had determined that the vehicle was now only able to move much more slowly, that it would soon cease to be able to operate at all, and that, in his experience, the driver would then attempt to flee on foot and could be safely arrested.TheSO’s compliance with theSuspect Apprehension Pursuitlegislation, however, is not dispositive of the matter.  The question to be determined is whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence, specifically, whether or not his driving rose to the level of being dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249 (1) of theCriminal Code.  As indicated earlier, it is clear that no bodily harm was occasioned by either ofCW#1 or the Complainant as a result of the collision and therefore the offence of dangerous driving causing bodily harm (s. 249 (3)) does not come into play.Pursuant to the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, s.249 requires that the driving be “dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place” and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances”.In applying the reasonable person test, I must consider whether theSO’s driving was a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person in his circumstances would observe.  As such, I must determine if his driving amounted to a marked departure from that of a police officer attempting a vehicle stop of a suspect vehicle whose driver has been confirmed as having committed a robbery and has now evaded police and is driving dangerously (as per the information relayed in the communications dispatch as: “So, the driver is the Complainant, he’s wanted for robbery, theft, times two, now flight and dangerous.)On a review of all of the evidence, it is clear that theSOwas likely travelling at a rate of speed in the area of 70 km/h in excess of the speed limit when he pursued the Ford Fiesta, as indicated by his own radio transmission and the determined average speed of his vehicle over the distance travelled during the pursuit.  However, based on all of the other evidence, it appears that road and weather conditions were good, traffic was moderate, the pursuit took place primarily in non-residential areas or vacant lots and commercial premises, with only the last extremely brief period, when the Complainant’s vehicle was already significantly damaged, taking place in a residential area, and the entire pursuit lasted no more than 61 seconds in total.Furthermore, it is clear that the Complainant had already engaged in a manner of dangerous driving from the time when he fled from the attempted arrest bySCUofficers, following which he ran at least one red light, and was driving at excessive rates of speed, prior to theSOever engaging in a pursuit.On this evidence, I find that it was the voluntary decision of the Complainant to try to outrun police and, in doing so, fleeing at a dangerous rate of speed with no regard for other people using the highway, which ultimately led to his colliding withCW#1’s vehicle. As such, I find that the evidence falls short of that required to satisfy me that I have reasonable grounds to believe that theSO’s driving rose to the level required to meet the necessary elements for dangerous driving, which would cause him to run afoul of theCriminal Code.In coming to my conclusion, I have considered the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Roy(2012), 281 C.C.C. (3d) 433, wherein the court held that a simple misjudgment could not reasonably support an inference of a marked departure, as follows:A fundamental point inBeattyis that dangerous driving is a serious criminal offence. It is, therefore, critically important to ensure that the fault requirement for dangerous driving has been established. Failing to do so unduly extends the reach of the criminal law and wrongly brands as criminals those who are not morally blameworthy. The distinction between ameredeparture, which may support civil liability, and themarkeddeparture required for criminal fault is a matter of degree. The trier of fact must identify how and in what way the departure from the standard goesmarkedlybeyond mere carelessness.And further:Simple carelessness, to which even the most prudent drivers may occasionally succumb, is generally not criminal. As noted earlier, Charron J., for the majority inBeatty, put it this way: ""If every departure from the civil norm is to be criminalized, regardless of the degree, we risk casting the net too widely and branding as criminals persons who are in reality not morally blameworthy"" (para. 34). The Chief Justice expressed a similar view: ""Even good drivers are occasionally subject to momentary lapses of attention. These may, depending on the circumstances, give rise to civil liability, or to a conviction for careless driving. But they generally will not rise to the level of a marked departure required for a conviction for dangerous driving"" (para. 71).And lastly:Driving which, objectively viewed, is simply dangerous, will not on its own support the inference that the accused departed markedly from the standard of care of a reasonable person in the circumstances (Charron J., at para. 49; see also McLachlin C.J., at para. 66, and Fish J., at para. 88). In other words, proof of theactus reusof the offence, without more, does not support a reasonable inference that the required fault element was present. Only driving that constitutes a marked departure from the norm may reasonably support that inference.I have also carefully considered the decision of our Court of Appeal inR. v. Pezzo, [1972] O.J. No. 965, that excessive speed alone does not necessarily equate with dangerous driving.  The following is an excerpt from that case, in which the Court found that the offence of dangerous driving was not made out despite the extremely high rate of speed at which the Appellant was travelling at the time:With respect to the dangerous driving there is very little evidence. The Crown gave particulars of the dangerous driving and restricted itself to excessive speed. My brother Arnup and I are of the opinion that on the scanty evidence presented it would be unsafe to maintain a conviction. The learned trial Judge said:•	""On all the evidence before me I find that you took this car, had it in your possession, stole it, were driving it. The car tipped over, on the evidence before me, after a skid mark of some 98 feet, flipped over on its back ... for another 42 feet skid mark which indicates a great deal of speed, a collision with the wall. On all the evidence before me I find you guilty of the charge of theft of a motor vehicle and dangerous driving.""With respect to the learned trial Judge we are not satisfied that the evidence clearly discloses that the appellant was driving in such a manner that the driving can be characterized as dangerous driving within the meaning of the relevant section of the Code. We would accordingly allow the appeal against conviction and direct an acquittal on the charge of dangerous driving.And the subsequent decision inR. v. M.K.M., [1998] O.J. No. 1606, that in certain circumstances, excessive speed alone may be sufficient to establish dangerous driving:Depending on the context in which it occurred, excessive speed can amount to a marked departure from the standard of care of a prudent driver. Here the context included the following: the accident occurred on a busy highway in a built up area of Mississauga, and just before the accident the appellant had been driving aggressively and engaging in ""horseplay"" on the road with her co-accused. Although their estimates of the appellant's driving speed varied, all of the independent witnesses testified that she was driving too fast. The evidence of …  all supported the trial judge's conclusion that the appellant was driving well above the speed limit and too quickly to avoid any unexpected occurrence on the highway. Indeed, Miss Black gave evidence that the appellant lost control of her car because she was driving too fast.Having fully considered the edicts from our Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada as to the factors to consider in assessing whether or not I have reasonable grounds to believe that there is sufficient evidence to make out a charge of dangerous driving, I do not find that it is made out on this record.Taking into account that the only evidence I have which would support a charge of dangerous driving would be that of a high rate of speed, countered by the evidence that the officer was only driving at that high rate of speed for a duration of less than 61 seconds, and that the test of a reasonable driver requires an assessment of what would be reasonable in the case of a police officer attempting to stop and investigate a motor vehicle which had been confirmed as having been involved in a robbery, I must conclude that, in the absence of some evidence that theSOwas driving in a dangerous manner other than the mere high speed at which he travelled, I find that the evidence is not sufficient to satisfy me that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the actions of theSOamounted to a ‘marked departure’ rather than a ‘mere departure’ of the standard of care of a reasonable police officer in these circumstances.The Arrest of the ComplainantPursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are restricted in their use of force to that which is reasonably necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from the information in the possession of theSOthat the driver of the Ford Fiesta was arrestable for offences of robbery, theft under (x2), flight from police, and dangerous driving, and that the robbery offence had been confirmed (10-63), that theSOhad more than reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was the suspect being sought and that he was arrestable for the offences indicated.  As such, the pursuit and apprehension of the Complainant was legally justified in the circumstances.With respect to theSOdeploying his service dog to catch and stop the Complainant, who was known to have already fled from police once, who was wanted for the serious violent offence of robbery for which he might reasonably have been suspected to have possessed a weapon, and who, after engaging theSOin a vehicular pursuit and showing no indication of a desire to give himself up, was now running from police despite the warnings issued by theSOthat the dog would be released if he did not stop, I find that theSO’s decision to deploy his dog was not only justified in the circumstances, but was both prudent and the option least likely to place theSOhimself at risk of harm.Furthermore, once the Complainant was down on the ground and appeared to be cooperating, theSOimmediately commanded his dog to release.  Even though the dog was deployed to engage with the Complainant a second time when that cooperation ended, and the Complainant seemed on the verge of again fleeing, the dog was again almost immediately ordered to disengage after biting the Complainant a second time.As such, where the dog was only engaged on the first occasion for three seconds, and on the second occasion for one second, following ample warnings issued to the Complainant, and there was no further use of force once back-up arrived, the Complainant was handcuffed, and the risk of flight removed, I find that theSOacted reasonably and that his actions did not amount to an excessive use of force, despite the serious injury sustained by the Complainant.  Clearly, had the Complainant heeded theSO’s warnings and not continued to flee, the dog would never have been deployed and the Complainant would have been arrested without incident.I find that the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Canada that I am not to hold police to an unattainable standard of perfection, as enunciated in their decision inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, is particularly apt in these circumstances.  It reads as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that both the pursuit and the ultimate apprehension of the Complainant, and the manner in which they were carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injury which the Complainant sustained. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that there is no evidence that the actions of theSOfell outside of the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.Date:	November 30, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=123

,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,The reports concluded that the cause of the Complainant’s death was cocaine toxicity in a man with cardiomegaly and atherosclerotic heart disease,"Shortly after 8:57:02 a.m., both police officers had arrived at the residence and were speaking with the Complainant.  The summary of the police transmissions, also referred to as the Event Chronology Report, indicates that it was reported that at 9:07:32 a.m., the Complainant was being seen by paramedics, at 9:19:49 he was taken into police custody, and at 9:24:09, the Complainant was in the ambulance and en route to hospital accompanied bySO#1, withSO#2 following in his police vehicle.  At 9:56:03 a.m., it was reported that the Complainant was at hospital but was Vital Signs Absent (VSA) and the doctors were working on him.  At 10:16 a.m., the Complainant was pronounced dead and theSIUwas notified and an investigation launched.On November 2, 2017, a post-mortem examination was conducted by a forensic pathologist, but no cause of death could be determined at that time pending the results of toxicological analyses of the Complainant’s blood and urine.  On October 17, 2018, theSIUreceived the Final Post-Mortem Report relating to the examination of the Complainant’s body, with the Toxicology Report attached.The Toxicology Report indicated that the Complainant had both cocaine and benzoylecgonine, the breakdown product of cocaine, in his system at the time of his death and that the cause of his death was determined to have been cocaine toxicity in a man with cardiomegaly (abnormal enlargement of the heart) and atherosclerotic heart disease (clogged arteries).  In other words, the Complainant’s death was attributable to his ingestion of cocaine which led to a cardiac incident followed by death.  While the Complainant was found to have some superficial abrasions to his face and body, those were determined to be unrelated to his death and did not contribute to his death in any way.During the course of this investigation, four civilian witnesses who were present during the police interaction with the Complainant, as well as a family member, and the doctor who worked on the Complainant, were interviewed.  While both subject officers, who were with the Complainant prior to his death, declined to make themselves available for an interview withSIUinvestigators, as is their legal right,SO#1 provided his notes of the incident for review.  One police witness was also interviewed, and five police officers provided their notes toSIUinvestigators.  In addition, theSIUinvestigators had access to a video prepared by an independent civilian witness of the interaction with police, as well as the Final Post-Mortem and Toxicology Reports prepared following the Complainant’s death.At no time was the Complainant alone with either ofSO#1 orSO#2, with at least one independent civilian witness being present from the first contact, until the Complainant was pronounced dead at hospital.  On that basis, despite neither subject officer providing a verbal statement toSIUinvestigators, the entirety of the interaction betweenSO#1 andSO#2 is accounted for and there is no dispute as to the facts.According to an independent civilian witness,CW#1, she kicked the Complainant out of her home at approximately 8:00 a.m. that morning and, when he returned a half hour later, she could immediately tell that he was high on cocaine; she was able to make this determination based on her prior experience dealing with the Complainant when he was high on cocaine.  As a result,CW#1 would not allow the Complainant back into her home and she observed him call 911, while he was outside of her house, and request police assistance.When the two police officers arrived at approximately 8:45 a.m.,CW#1 heard them ask the Complainant to identify himself and he did so;CW#1 then went inside her home and closed the door. Shortly thereafter,CW#1 heard the Complainant calling out, “Help me!” and she looked out and saw him lying on his stomach, with the two police officers over top of him attempting to handcuff him.CW#1 then opened her door and asked what was going on and one of the officers indicated that the Complainant was “trippin.”CW#1 observed the Complainant to be resisting the attempts to handcuff him by squirming and writhing on the ground.CW#2 looked out from his residence and observed the two police officers attempting to arrest the Complainant, who he described as struggling and resisting.CW#2 observed the struggle move across the street and onto the ground, at which pointCW#2 began to video record the interaction on his cell phone.CW#2 described the police officers as trying to hold the Complainant down on the ground, while he continued to resist and was yelling, “Help me!”  The Complainant was described as lying face down with one police officer kneeling beside the Complainant with one knee on the Complainant’s leg, while he used his left arm to try to keep the Complainant down, while a second officer, using his right arm, was trying to pull the Complainant’s arm out from under him for handcuffing, while the Complainant continued to try to pull his arm away.CW#2 indicated that neither police officer was punching or kicking the Complainant, but that they were simply trying to overpower him and to calm him down and handcuff him; no use of force options were used.CW#2 observed the Complainant eventually have his hands handcuffed behind his back, while he continued to pull away from the officers.  The Complainant was then placed onto a stretcher and moved to a waiting ambulance.  The video recording made byCW#2 fully confirms this version of events.CW#4, one of two paramedics who attended to assess the Complainant, indicated that upon his arrival, the Complainant was standing on the sidewalk facing the two police officers.CW#4 described the Complainant as holding his cell phone in one hand and being very fidgety and picking at his skin, while the two officers stood an arm’s length or two away from the Complainant asking him what was going on. The Complainant responded that he didn’t know what was going on, while he constantly moved from left to right and moved his arms around.  The police officers then told the paramedics that the Complainant had ingested cocaine and needed to be assessed.  The Complainant then entered the ambulance with the two paramedics while the police officers remained outside.Once inside the ambulance, both paramedics,CW#4 and his partner,CW#3, heard the Complainant indicate that he had consumed cocaine on that date but that he had purchased it from someone other than his usual supplier; he would not disclose how much cocaine he had ingested.  While the paramedics found the Complainant’s heart rate to be elevated, they cleared him medically and asked him to exit the ambulance.When the Complainant exited the ambulance, one of the police officers tapped him on the shoulder and told him that he was under arrest, at which point the Complainant became combative and screamed, “Help me!”, while trying to throw the police officer, who was attempting to take him by the arm, off of him.  One of the police officers was heard to tell the Complainant to stop resisting, but he continued to struggle for approximately 20 seconds.CW#4 described the two police officers as holding the Complainant’s right arm behind his back and then moving him onto his knees on the driveway, following which they lowered him to the ground and onto his stomach, where the Complainant rubbed his face on the pavement while screaming and fighting.CW#4 then observed the Complainant to punch, with enormous strength, at the police officer trying to control and handcuff his right arm, causing the officer to move back and towards the Complainant’s lower back, at which point the Complainant tried to kick his heels at the officer, and both paramedics moved in to assist in holding the Complainant down.CW#3, the second paramedic, described the physical interaction between the two police officers and the Complainant as the Complainant becoming aggressive and combative, while thrashing his arms and elbows from side to side as he tried to get away from the officers while they were trying to arrest him.CW#3 heard the Complainant scream, “Get off me!” while the two police officers, who she described as being both calm and respectful, with neither cursing or yelling at the Complainant, were telling the Complainant, “Sir, try to calm down, we have to put you in handcuffs, you’ll be going with us in the police car.”CW#3 observed the two police officers take the Complainant down to his knees and then onto his stomach on the asphalt driveway, which she described as the Complainant’s body buckling as the officers “lowered” him onto his stomach, with the Complainant yelling at the top of his voice throughout.CW#3 stated that the Complainant’s contact with the asphalt did not cause her any concern.  After the Complainant was down on his stomach, one police officer straddled the Complainant across the small of his back, while the second tried to control the Complainant’s left hand and arm.  The Complainant continued to resist and clenched his fist around his own hair, while dragging his face left and right and back and forth across the asphalt, badly scuffing his face and causing abrasions.The Complainant was observed, by both paramedics, to be eventually handcuffed with both hands behind his back using two sets of handcuffs.  When the Complainant then kicked the back of his heels at the back of one of the police officers,CW#3 placed her left foot on one of his legs, whileCW#4 did the same with the other, in order to hold his legs to the ground.  Both paramedics advised that at no time did any police officer or paramedic ever strike or kick the Complainant, nor did either police officer produce any use of force equipment.  When the officers asked the Complainant politely to please get up, he refused to do so and the officers had to lift him up, at which point it was observed that the Complainant had abraded his face and his nose was bleeding.  As a result of both his self-inflicted injuries, and his odd behaviour, which the paramedics surmised may have been indicative of his suffering from excited delirium, the Complainant was no longer considered to be eligible to be medically cleared and the decision was made that he was to be taken to the hospital in the ambulance, and the Complainant was placed onto a stretcher while the officers controlled his arms and the paramedics his legs, with the Complainant continuing to fight and kick the entire time.The Complainant was then transported to the hospital in the back of the ambulance, escorted bySO#1.  Upon arrival, the Complainant was taken into the hospital on the stretcher where he went into medical distress and was found to be without vital signs.  Chest compressions were then started and the Complainant was taken to the resuscitation room and the handcuffs were removed.  Unfortunately, the Complainant could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 10:16 a.m.The attending physician who worked on the Complainant indicated that his observations leading up to the Complainant’s death were consistent with the Complainant’s death being as a result of a cocaine overdose inducing arrhythmia, or a heart attack.  The doctor had no concerns whatsoever with respect to the abrasions on the Complainant’s face and body and opined that they did not contribute to his death; the medical opinion of the attending physician was later confirmed by the Final Post-Mortem and Toxicology reports.The notes provided bySO#1 of his involvement in the Complainant’s arrest and transport were fully consistent with, and confirmed by, all of the other evidence.Having reviewed all of the evidence with respect to this matter, it is clear that there is no causal connection between the death of the Complainant and the actions ofSO#1 andSO#2.  Furthermore, based on the observations of all of the civilian witnesses present, it is clear that the response ofSO#1 andSO#2 to the Complainant’s resistance and combativeness was to resort to no more than the minimal amount of force required in order to handcuff the Complainant and place him onto the stretcher in order that he get the medical attention that he required.  Furthermore, the evidence of all of the civilian witnesses present confirmed that the officers were at all times calm, courteous, and professional towards the Complainant.On the record before me, I find that there is absolutely no evidence that either of the arresting officers resorted to an excessive use of force in dealing with the Complainant, or that their actions in any way caused or contributed to his unfortunate death.  As such, since I lack the necessary grounds for the laying of criminal charges, none shall issue.Date:	November 30, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=104

,Halton Regional Police Service,Halton,Ontario,The fractures were approximately 2 cms from the Complainant’s spine,"On September 29, 2017, members of the squad were made aware that the Complainant, who was out of custody on parole, was wanted on charges of domestic assault and parole violations related thereto, and they set about to locate and arrest him for these violations and offences.Following his arrest, the Complainant was transported to hospital where he was assessed and it was determined that he had sustained two non-displaced fractures to the posterior of the 11th and 12th ribs on his right side. These fractures were located approximately 2 cms from his spine. While aCTscan performed on the Complainant revealed indications of two old fractures to the posterior of the Complainant’s 9th and 11th ribs, the two fractures to the posterior 11th and 12th ribs were found to have no new growth or evidence of healing, causing the medical experts to opine that the fractures occurred within a time frame of just prior to the images being taken, up to several weeks prior to the Complainant’s interaction with police on September the 29.It is alleged that the two rib fractures sustained by the Complainant were caused by resort to an excessive use of force by the police officers arresting him.During the course of this investigation, in addition to the Complainant, one civilian witness was interviewed. While this witness did not observe the actual arrest of the Complainant, he was able to provide some evidence with respect to the events leading up to the Complainant’s arrest. Additionally, four witness police officers and one of the subject officers,SO#1, were interviewed, with the second subject officer,SO#2, declining to be interviewed as is his legal right. Unfortunately, there was no physical evidence located, in the form of audio or video recordings, which would be capable of confirming exactly what occurred during the Complainant’s arrest.With the exception of the actions of police during the actual arrest of the Complainant, there appears to be little disagreement as to the facts which lead up to that arrest, the facts of which follow.On September 29, 2017,SO#1 was made aware that the Complainant was wanted for assaulting a former girlfriend and thereby breaching the provisions of his parole release.SO#1 was familiar with the Complainant through a prior interaction, wherein the Complainant had tried to escape from police by running out of the back of a residence.Having been advised of the outstanding warrants for the arrest of the Complainant, theROPEsquad made efforts to attempt to locate the Complainant, including engaging the assistance of his cell phone provider to try and track his location through the use of his cell phone.Police were provided with the Complainant’s address, and attended that address in order to carry out surveillance in the hopes of locating and apprehending the Complainant. The cell phone provider confirmed the location of the Complainant’s cell phone as being in the area of his residence at that time. Police attended outside of the Complainant’s residence at approximately 9:00 am, where they first checked the Complainant’s apartment; when he could not be located, they contained the area awaiting his return.Through further investigation, police learned that the Complainant had earlier that morning made a telephone call from the landline associated with an apartment unit in an adjacent building to his own. Consultation with the landlord,CW#1, revealed that the unit belonged toCW#1’s mother, who was in hospital at that time.CW#1 escorted the police to his mother’s apartment, unlocked the door for them, and gave them permission to enter and search for the Complainant.The Complainant, in his statement to investigators, readily conceded that he had observed the police officers in the area and that he had surmised that they were looking for him, and that he actively hid from them.The Complainant heard footsteps outside of the apartment where he had concealed himself, and then heard a key being used to unlock the door, followed by voices. The Complainant moved to a rear bedroom and hid behind the bedroom door.While the Complainant indicated that the police officers did not announce themselves when they entered the apartment, nor did they call out his name, the police officers involved indicated that as soon as they entered,SO#1 called out, “(First name of the Complainant), it’s theROPEsquad, come out, you are under arrest,” which he called out several times without receiving any response.The police evidence, in this regard, is at least partially confirmed by the evidence ofCW#1, who was standing outside of the apartment at the time and heard police officers calling, “Come out with your hands up!” As such, based on the evidence ofCW#1, I accept that police made some type of announcement upon entry, although little turns on it, as the Complainant openly conceded that he knew the men were police officers and that they were there to arrest him.The Complainant alleges that while he was hiding behind the slightly ajar bedroom door in the rear bedroom, with his back to the wall behind the partially open door, the door was kicked inwards, causing it to come off its hinges and striking him in the left shoulder. The force of the door hitting the Complainant caused him to spin around, at which point he was grabbed by his right wrist and he felt something hit him on the head, over his left eye. This evidence is at least partially confirmed by the observations of the police officers that the Complainant, when he was later removed from the bedroom, had a small cut above his left eye.The Complainant indicated that he believed that the injury over his left eye was caused when he was taken to the floor, but he could not see which police officer or officers was involved in taking him down. The Complainant indicated that he was unable to breathe and he was screaming. He could not recall how he landed on the floor because, he indicated, he had blacked out. The Complainant further alleges that once on the floor, he was beaten by police officers, although he could not identify which officer was involved or whether he was punched or kicked.The Complainant indicated that he could not recall how many police officers were in the room and he could not describe any of them. The Complainant did not recall ever being told why he was being arrested or why the police were looking for him and could neither recall being handcuffed nor being assisted up off of the floor. The Complainant indicated that at no time did he resist the police officers.CW#1, who was located outside of the apartment, was only able to assist in that he advised that he thought he heard the sound of a door being pushed in, but he never heard any sounds of fighting within the apartment.SO#1,SO#2,WO#2 andWO#1, after having searched the remainder of the apartment without results, then made their way down the hall to the bedroom.SO#1 was in the lead, followed bySO#2,WO#2, and finallyWO#1.SO#1 pushed the door open and started to step forward, at which point the door was pushed back hard from inside the room.SO#1 stated that he reacted by pushing the door hard, in order to force it open, while yelling “Police, you are under arrest”.SO#1 described the Complainant as hiding, with his back to the wall, behind the door trying to keep the door closed. This evidence appears consistent with, and confirmed by, the evidence of the Complainant himself.According toSO#1,SO#2 managed to then enter the room just ahead ofSO#1 and he grabbed hold of the Complainant by the right side, while the Complainant continued to push against the door.SO#1 then reached for the Complainant’s left shoulder while yelling at him, telling him he was under arrest and to get on the floor. The Complainant was described as resisting and clenching up his body, following whichSO#1 andSO#2 pulled him forward and forced him down onto the floor.WO#1 indicated that he lagged behind the other three police officers as they went down the hallway, as he had stopped to speak withCW#1. When he approached the bedroom door, he stated that he immediately heard struggling after having heard the three other police officers yell, and he observed that the door was open. As he reached the threshold, he notedSO#2,SO#1, andWO#2 struggling with the Complainant and the Complainant immediately being taken to the floor, withSO#2 falling with him.SO#1 described the forward momentum of pulling the Complainant out from behind the door and down to the floor as causingSO#2 to also lose his balance and fall on top of the Complainant, landing on the Complainant’s back, on the right side. This evidence appearsconsistent with the injuries sustained by the Complainant, which were described in the Diagnostic Imaging Report as “new nondisplaced fractures at the head of posterior right 11th and 12th ribs”, which would appear to be consistent with someone landing on top of the Complainant’s back on the right side, as was described ofSO#2.At that point,SO#1 was near the Complainant’s head,SO#2 went to his right side, andWO#2, who had at that point entered the bedroom, then went to the Complainant’s left side.WO#1 observed the Complainant to be holding a dark coloured object in his left hand as he went to the floor, and then use his left hand to tuck the object under his body.WO#1 then yelled out a warning that the Complainant had something concealed in his left hand.While efforts byWO#2 to get the Complainant to release his left hand and give it up for handcuffing were unsuccessful,SO#2 was observed to deliver a couple of closed fisted strikes to the right side of the Complainant’s body, whichSO#1 described as being ineffective, as the Complainant still refused to bring his left arm out from under his body. As a consequence,SO#1 then also delivered closed fisted punches, this time three to four, to the left shoulder area of the Complainant.SO#1 stated that he used no other use of force options, nor did he strike the Complainant anywhere other than in the left shoulder area.WO#1 described all four of the police officers as yelling at the Complainant to stop fighting, whileWO#1 held onto the Complainant’s legs as the Complainant was trying to get onto his knees to lift himself from the floor.WO#2, in his statement, indicated that he too delivered three or four closed fisted punches to the left side of the Complainant when the Complainant refused to give up his arm, and becauseWO#2 was concerned that the Complainant might have some type of weapon in his left hand.WO#2 described his punches as landing in the kidney area and he believed that it was these punches which ultimately caused the Complainant to release his left arm, following which he was handcuffed.SO#2 then managed to apply a handcuff to the Complainant’s right hand, whileSO#1 andWO#2 grabbed the Complainant’s left arm and managed to pull it free from under his body and it was handcuffed as well.The Complainant was then rolled over and it was observed that he had lost his glasses and that he had a small cut above his left eye. The Complainant was then heard to complain that his ribs were sore. When the Complainant was assisted to his feet, a cellular phone and a black-handled steak knife were found on the floor in the area of where his body had been lying, although no police officer actually saw the Complainant holding the knife.The Complainant alleges that he was beaten by police and the four police officers have openly conceded that the following blows were delivered to the Complainant while he was down on the floor:SO#2 was described bySO#1 as delivering two closed fisted punches to the Complainant’s right side, whileWO#1 was of the view thatSO#2 delivered one to two closed fisted punches to the Complainant’s left side;SO#1 conceded that he delivered three to four closed fisted punches to the Complainant’s left shoulder area; andWO#2 agreed that he also delivered three to four closed fisted punches landing in the Complainant’s left side kidney area.On the basis of these concessions, it is clear that in their efforts to get the Complainant to give up his hands and to handcuff him, police delivered at least eight to ten punches to the Complainant’s body, from which the Complainant could legitimately have believed that the police were ‘beating’ him.Although the version of events as between police and the Complainant only varies in minor degrees, based on the evidence ofCW#1 as to his observations, I do not accept that the Complainant was screaming and could not breathe while he was on the floor, as no screams were ever heard byCW#1, who was just outside the apartment, and because it is obvious that if one cannot breathe, one cannot scream.Furthermore, while the Complainant believed that he was struck by something to the head as he was being taken to the floor, which caused the cut just above his left eye, I accept that it is most likely, due to the nature of the injury, that it was the door that struck the Complainant and it was either the door or a combination of the door and his dislodged glasses which likely caused what was described in his medical records as an “abrasion to his left eyelid”, as no other use of force options were observed as having been resorted to by any police officer, nor was any object observed by the Complainant himself.Finally, I have some difficulty with the Complainant’s version of events in that he was unable to distinguish between being kicked or punched by the police officers, while I would have thought it would be fairly easy to distinguish between a fist and a boot. Also, while the Complainant told investigators that his memory was foggy due to a head injury and that he had lost consciousness during his interaction with police, the medical records indicate that the Complainant did not lose consciousness at any time.On an assessment of the reliable evidence, then, I accept that the Complainant likely received the abrasion to his left eyelid when he was struck by the door that he was hiding behind. I further conclude that when the Complainant refused to voluntarily emerge from behind the bedroom door where he had secreted himself, that he was forcibly pulled out and that the momentum causedSO#2 to fall with, and on top of, the Complainant, likely causing the injury to his right posterior ribs near the spine, as none of the punches delivered appear to be consistent with the location of his injuries. Finally, I find that while police were attempting to restrain and handcuff the Complainant, they delivered between eight to 10 punches to the Complainant, as described above.The question to be addressed, then, is whether or not these actions amounted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances.Pursuant to s. 25(1) of theCriminal Codeof Canada, a police officer, if he acts on reasonable grounds, is justified in using as much force as is necessary in the execution of a lawful duty. As such, in order for the police officers to qualify for protection from prosecution pursuant to s. 25, it must be established that they were in the execution of a lawful duty, that they were acting on reasonable grounds, and that they used no more force than was necessary.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from the information provided toSO#1, which was based on the information provided by the Complainant’s former girlfriend as to his assault upon her, and the fact that the Complainant could only be at large as long as he acted in accordance with his parole conditions, that each of the members of theROPEsquad who attended to arrest the Complainant were acting lawfully and pursuant to their duties. As such, the apprehension and arrest of the Complainant was legally justified in the circumstances.An assessment of the use of force resorted to by each of the police officers then requires an assessment of whether the following actions were excessive in these circumstances:The pushing of the door against the Complainant, while he was hiding behind the door and pushing it back against the police officers;SO#2’s taking the Complainant to the floor and landing on top of him;SO#2 delivering one to two punches to the Complainant’s torso;SO#1 delivering three to four punches to the Complainant’s left shoulder area; and,WO#2 delivering three to four punches to the Complainant’s left side kidney area.I have no hesitation in finding that the forceful opening of the door, when the Complainant was resisting the door being opened, and his subsequently being struck by the door or striking something as he fell to the floor, was not an excessive use of force in these circumstances.It is clear that the Complainant was aware that police were present to arrest him and he was actively first hiding from them, and then resisting their entry into the bedroom to effect his arrest. I accept that these actions bySO#1 andSO#2, in these circumstances, were completely reasonable and carried out in the course of their lawful duties, and these actions would be exempt from prosecution pursuant to s. 25 (1) of theCriminal Code.Equally, I find the actions ofSO#2 in then forcing the Complainant to the floor in order to gain control over him, to be equally reasonable and justified and exempt from prosecution. It appears likely that the combined momentum of the Complainant resisting being removed from behind the door, coupled withSO#2’s pulling him clear of the door, is likely what causedSO#2 to fall on top of the Complainant, thereby causing the Complainant’s injuries. While it is clear on all of the evidence that police were present in order to lawfully arrest and detain the Complainant, he could not be allowed to thwart that lawful endeavour by either hiding or forcibly resisting his arrest.Once the Complainant was on the floor, having been observed byWO#2 to have something black clutched in his left hand, to whichWO#2 alerted the other officers, police had to act quickly and with some determination to ensure that they were not at risk from a possible weapon. In order to do so, it was incumbent upon police to disarm and handcuff the Complainant as soon as possible to eliminate the risk that he continued to pose until that was achieved. The presence of the black handled knife in the immediate area where the Complainant had been lying on the floor while engaging with police certainly appears to confirm, in hindsight, the legitimacy of the concerns of the involved police officers.While I accept that the Complainant may have believed that he was being beaten by police, and while he was of the view that he was not actively resisting, I fully accept that his refusal to give up his hands was a form of active resistance and that police were entitled to use necessary force to subdue the Complainant, as long as it was no more than was justified in these circumstances.On these facts, where the initial strikes to the Complainant appeared to have been ineffective and did not gain compliance, and where no further strikes were delivered after the Complainant gave up his hands and was handcuffed, I find that the actions of the police officers were both measured and proportionate to the degree of resistance being put up by the Complainant and did not amount to an excessive use of force in this factual situation.In making this finding, I have considered the direction from the Supreme Court of Canada as set out inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]I have also considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.In conclusion, upon a thorough analysis of all of the available and reliable evidence, I find that the evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer involved in the arrest of the Complainant resorted to an excessive use of force. I further find that had the Complainant voluntarily given himself up, rather than hiding andthen later resisting, when he was fully aware that police were there to arrest him, policewould not have had to resort to any force whatsoever. As such, I find that I am without the necessary grounds upon which to lay criminal charges and none shall issue.Date: July 12, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=74
,Toronto Police Service,Markham,Ontario,He stated during his interview however that he had sustained a fracture to his right foot as a result of a vehicle driving over his foot prior to his interaction with police,"Consequently, theSOmade a left turn in his police cruiser and activated his emergency lighting system in order to conduct a traffic stop for an infraction of theHighway Traffic Act; the motorcyclist, however, continued to travel southbound at a high rate of speed and collided with a street sign located on the median on Markham Road at Select Avenue, whereupon the rider of the motorcycle became airborne and then landed on the roadway in the northbound lane of Markham Road.  Twenty-five seconds later, theSOcame upon the collision scene, but the driver had already fled on foot.CW#1, in her statement, indicated that she was driving northbound on Markham Road when she observed a motorcycle travelling southbound drive over the centre median and the driver became airborne, after which he landed on the roadway near his motorcycle.CW#1 observed the driver looking for his shoe, after which he approached her to ask for a ride home, but she declined.CW#1 described the driver of the motorcycle, including distinctive scarring to the face; the description, including the scarring, matched that of the Complainant.CW#1 advised the driver that he should go to the hospital.CW#1 then observed theSOdriving southbound on Markham Road toward the collision scene with his emergency lights activated.  He pulled up to the location of the collision, whereupon the motorcyclist looked at her, told her he had to go, and ran off.CW#1 told theSOthe direction in which the motorcyclist had run.The Complainant was later located in the area and appeared to have suffered an injury, as a result of which he was transported to the hospital, where he was assessed as having sustained a fracture to his right foot.SIUinvestigators did not have access to the medical records of the Complainant to confirm his injury, as he declined to sign a consent for that purpose.The Complainant, in his statement, indicated that he had been out with friends, on the evening of September 24th, 2017, when he got into an altercation with a group of unknown males, one of whom drove over the Complainant’s foot with his car, while trying to flee.  The Complainant stated that he sustained several injuries as a result of this altercation, including the injury to his foot.  The Complainant denies that he was the operator of the motorcycle which theSOattempted to investigate, advising that he does not own nor has he ever operated a motorcycle, and that he is not capable of operating a motorcycle due to having previously suffered serious injuries including the scarring on his face which prevented him from being able to use both hands.On all of the evidence, but based primarily on the observations ofCW#1, I accept that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was the operator of the motorcycle whom theSOattempted to stop and investigate for variousHTAinfractions; however, based on the Complainant’s own statement, there is an absolute absence of any evidence to indicate that  the Complainant’s injury was sustained by the single vehicle motorcycle collision in which he was allegedly involved, as he is very firm in his contention that he was injured earlier the previous evening when an unknown male drove over his foot with his car.In the absence of any definitive evidence that the Complainant was injured in the motorcycle collision, there is no evidence to establish a causal connection between the actions of theSOand the injury sustained by the Complainant.On the basis, however, that there is some evidence upon which one could reasonably conclude that the Complainant was the operator of the motorcycle, I will add that theICCvideo, theCCTVvideos, and the evidence ofCW#1 all provide reasonable grounds to believe that theSO, while having engaged his emergency equipment in an attempt to perform a vehicle stop of the motorcyclist, at no time engaged the motorcyclist in a vehicle pursuit, in that he was driving quite a distance back from the motorcyclist, the motorcycle was out of his view, and there was a gap of some 15 seconds between the observation of the motorcycle and the police cruiser on the videos.Furthermore,CW#1 did not first observe theSO’s police cruiser until sometime after the motorcycle had already crashed and the driver had approached and spoken with her.  On this basis, I accept that theSOwas in no way engaged with the motorcyclist at the time that the collision occurred.  As such, if the Complainant was the motorcyclist, which he firmly denies, and if he was injured in the single vehicle collision, which he also firmly denies, there is no evidence upon which I can find reasonable grounds to believe that theSOengaged the Complainant in a vehicular pursuit thereby causing him to crash and causing his injuries.The final question to be determined is whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence, specifically, whether or not his driving rose to the level of being dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249 (1) of theCriminal Code, there being no need to consider dangerous driving causing bodily harm, as the Complainant has clearly indicated that he did not sustain his injury during the collision.The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, indicates that in order to make out an offence of dangerous driving, s.249 requires that the driving be dangerous to the public, “having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place” and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances.”On a review of all of the evidence, it is clear that while theSOdrove in excess of the speed limit in his initial attempt to stop and investigate the motorcyclist, there is no evidence that his driving created a danger to other users of the roadway or that he at any time interfered with other traffic.  Additionally, the environmental conditions were good and the roads were dry.Ultimately, I am of the opinion that  the Complainant, if he was indeed the operator of the motorcycle, chose to operate his motor vehicle at dangerous speeds and in contravention of various rules of the road and was therefore solely responsible for the collision and any consequences of that collision, which I am unable to determine.Furthermore, it appears that the attempt by theSOto stop the motorcyclist did not exacerbate the motorcyclist’s driving, as he was already travelling at a high rate of speed and disobeying traffic signals before theSOever attempted to pull him over, and he continued to drive in the same fashion thereafter, eventually losing control of his vehicle and causing the crash.I find on this evidence that the driving of theSO, in attempting to stop and investigate the motorcycle driver for variousHighway Traffic Actinfractions, does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute ‘a marked departure from the norm.’ Additionally, I am unable to establish that there was a causal connection between the actions of theSOand the collision or the injuries sustained by the Complainant.  As such, I find that there is no evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed and no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.Date: July 12, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=119
,Ontario Provincial Police,Chatham-Kent,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital and an x-ray was taken of his left hand which revealed an oblique oriented fracture through the shaft of the fourth metacarpal the bone in the ring finger closest to the ‘pinkie’ with a mild displacement of the fracture fragment measuring about six millimetres,"The Complainant, in his statement toSIUinvestigators, stated that he was riding a bicycle given to him by a friend, unaware that it was stolen, when theSOpulled up behind him in a police vehicle.  The Complainant advised that he went off of the roadway and into someone’s backyard in order that he not have to deal with police.  The Complainant advised that at the time of the incident, he was foggy as he was coming off of pills (opiates).The Complainant alleged that theSOtold him that he was under arrest for trespassing and to put the bicycle down; as soon as he did so, however, theSOstarted to punch him in the head and in his side.  The Complainant put up a fight and tried to get away, as he had done nothing wrong.  The Complainant alleged that theSOtold him, “You’re going down,” while he was beating him,  and the Complainant pushed back against theSOand tried to hold theSO’s hands to prevent him from striking the Complainant.  They wrestled for about five minutes, during which they had moved from the backyard to the back fence area.The Complainant further alleged that theSOtook out hisCEWand deployed it about four times, but it did not really bother the Complainant, and he just ripped out the prongs. He advised that he had four red marks on his stomach where he had been struck with the probes.  Because theSOkept deploying theCEW, the Complainant had to jump the fence to get away.  After running through some backyards, the Complainant was tackled by sevenCKPSofficers.  The Complainant indicated that he realized that his left hand had been injured and was painful when he was on the fence.  He was later told that his left hand was fractured and he believed that it happened when theSOslammed him against the exterior brick wall of a house, and his hand smashed into the wall with his own left hip compressing his hand, as the momentum carried his body into the wall.During the course of this investigation, three civilian witnesses, including the Complainant, and five Witness Officer’s (WO’s), including theSO, were interviewed.SIUinvestigators also had access to the police radio transmissions recording and the memorandum book notes of allWO’s, as well as the Complainant’s medical records, the booking photo of the Complainant, the download data from theSO’sCEW, and photos taken of the injuries to theSO’s face on the date in question.The Complainant’s paramedic records indicate that when being assessed, the Complainant “Stated that he had used crystal meth aprox (sic) 3-4 hours ago and was coming down off it.  No other complaints.”In his hospital records, the Complainant is quoted as indicating to medical staff, “Crystal meth, tased by police, now coming down, nauseated and vomiting, thirsty” and in his triage notes “C/o (complains of) weakness, thirst, nausea and L (left) hand pain after altercation with CKPD where he was tasered (possibly multiple times).  Patient states used meth 4-6 hours ago …”  Other than being ‘tasered’ by police, there is no notation anywhere in the Complainant’s records that he made any complaint about police, and there is no mention whatsoever that he was ever assaulted or beaten by any officer.CW#1, in his written statement to police and in his interview with theSIU, advised that he saw theSOwrestling with the Complainant, between two houses on Adelaide Street, and he called 911 to let them know that theSOwas struggling to arrest the Complainant and required assistance.  In his written statement, he opined that the struggle was as a result of the Complainant “Trying to fight him (theSO) off and trying to flee.”  He then observed theSOpush the Complainant against the brick wall of a residence, back first; he described the Complainant as holding onto theSO’s vest while theSOwas attempting to control the Complainant and turn him around to face the wall.CW#1 observed the Complainant to then suddenly drop down, with his shirt coming off, and he then shoved theSOand broke free, running to the rear of the yard and climbing the fence; he described theSOtrying to pull him off the fence and indicated that this may have been when theSOdeployed hisCEW, or tried to, but the Complainant made it over the fence.CW#2 was in a residence near the location where theSOand the Complainant were engaged.CW#2 indicated that he was inside the residence when he heard the Complainant yell as if in pain; he looked out and saw theSOtrying to contain the Complainant at the fence in the backyard of a neighbouring property.CW#2 saw the Complainant behind a tree and heard theSOsay, “Put your hands behind your back,” to which the Complainant responded, “Ok, ok,” and theSOthen backed away holding hisCEWin his right hand pointed at the Complainant.  The Complainant then jumped over the rear fence andCW#2 heard a sound that he equated with the use of theCEW, but he did not think that it struck the Complainant.CW#2 also saw theSOjump over the fence, but he returned within two minutes and indicated the direction in which the Complainant had run to another officer who had just arrived.CW#2 described theSOat that time as being out of breath and observed him to have blood on his forehead and a cut on his nose.TheSO, in his statement, indicated that he recognized the bicycle that the Complainant was riding as being identified as stolen in an earlier email that had been circulated; additionally, the Complainant was holding two large duffle bags on his handlebars, which he described as catching his attention as the area was known to be a high property crime area.  TheSOobserved the Complainant enter the backyard of a residence and, because he was aware that the Complainant did not live there, he formed the opinion that the Complainant was trying to hide from him.TheSOthen followed and located the Complainant hiding behind a tree and advised him that he was under arrest for possession of stolen property and trespassing, at which point the Complainant took off running.TheSOstated that he grabbed the Complainant by his shirt, but the Complainant spun away and out of his shirt, leaving theSOholding his shirt, but not the Complainant.  TheSOthen again caught up with the Complainant and grabbed his left arm, but the Complainant spun to the right and hit theSOin the bridge of his nose with his right elbow, stunning theSOand causing him to lose his hold on the Complainant.  TheSOstated that he grabbed the Complainant by the shoulders to push him to the ground, but he was unable to do so, with the Complainant remaining standing with his upper body bent over.  TheSOthen put his torso and weight onto the Complainant’s back and held the Complainant by the waist while issuing commands to stop resisting and to get on the ground, to which the Complainant responded, “I will, I will.”  This evidence appears to be supported by the observations ofCW#2.TheSOindicated that he noticed that one of the pouches on his uniform was keying his microphone, and he heard dispatch ask if he was okay, but he was unable to respond.  This is consistent with the evidence ofWO#1, who advised that he heard a broadcast of theSOactivating his talk button on his portable radio but nothing being said, while only rumbling and rustling was heard as if theSOwas in a struggle.  This causedWO#1 to attend to assist theSO.TheSOstated that during the struggle, he and the Complainant backed into a brick wall of the house and theSOhurt his shoulder from plowing into the wall. TheSOadvised that at that point he was feeling fatigued and he could feel blood running down his nose.TheSOindicated that he was of the view that the struggle needed to end, so he reached for hisCEW, which the Complainant then “pawed” at, knocking it out of his hand.  When theSOreached to pick up theCEW, the Complainant broke free.  TheSOthen picked up theCEWand deployed it, but it was ineffective and the Complainant kept running towards the fence.  TheSOcaught up with the Complainant and deployed hisCEWa second time, this time in drive stun mode (putting theCEWdirectly against the skin, without the use of probes), but this too was ineffective.TheSOalleged that the Complainant then grabbed theCEW, which theSOwas holding with both hands, and theSOcommanded the Complainant to stop resisting and get on the ground.  The Complainant then released his grip on theCEWand theSOwas able to pull it away from the Complainant, who then jumped the six foot rear privacy fence.  Since the Complainant was shirtless, theSOwas only able to grab onto his belt and the Complainant then spun and struck theSOabove his left eyebrow with what theSOassumed was his fist.TheSOstated that he pulled hard on the belt and brought the Complainant down off of the fence and then deployed hisCEWin normal mode (using the prong cartridge), and two prongs struck the Complainant in the chest, but this was also ineffective and the Complainant turned, jumped the fence, and ran.  TheSOadvised that he too then hopped the fence, but the Complainant was in the distance, so he holstered hisCEW, broadcast his location and the fact that the Complainant was fleeing, and returned to his vehicle; he described himself at that point as being out of breath and bleeding from his nose.The evidence ofWO#1 is again consistent with that of theSO, in that when he arrived, he observed theSOto be out of breath and with marks on his face, and theSOpointed in a direction and said the Complainant’s name.WO#3 also indicated, in his statement, that he observed theSOat his police vehicle and described him as being out of breath, perspiring, and having a cut on the left side of his face, a cut to the right side of his nose, and that he was bleeding.  TheSOthen relayed toWO#3 what had occurred, and this account was totally consistent with his statement toSIUinvestigators.WO#1 stated that he was then approached byCW#1, who indicated that he had seen the Complainant at the Montessori School, andWO#1 andWO#2 then attended the school where they caught the Complainant and pulled him from a fence to the ground by the back of his pants.While the Complainant was being seen at hospital,WO#4 overheard him tell medical staff that he had injured his hand during a struggle when he hit it “Between a fence.”Photos taken of theSOshortly after the incident confirmed that he had sustained injuries to his nose and forehead.Based on the evidence of the two civilian witnesses, who saw almost the entirety of the interaction between theSOand the Complainant in the rear yard of the residence to which the complainant had fled, I am unable to accept the evidence of the Complainant that theSOrepeatedly punched him in the head and side and slammed him against the exterior brick wall of the house wherein he smashed his hand into the wall due to the momentum of the forward movement of his body against the wall and his hand being compressed by his left hip.With respect to the punching, it is clear thatCW#1 saw almost the entire incident between theSOand the Complainant and he at no time saw theSOstrike or punch the Complainant, but rather described the physical interaction as a struggle which appeared due to the Complainant fighting theSOin order to flee, and theSOattempting to control him.With respect to the smashing into the wall, it is clear on the evidence ofCW#1 that rather than smashing the Complainant into the wall, theSOand the Complainant both went towards the wall during the struggle and the Complainant went back first against the wall while holding onto theSO’s vest with both hands.  On that evidence, while he had both hands on theSO’s vest, he clearly could not have smashed his hand between his hip and the wall.Additionally,CW#2 also described theSOas trying to “contain” the Complainant and observed the injuries to theSO’s face and that theSOwas out of breath, following his interaction with the Complainant.Relying primarily on the evidence of the two independent civilian witnesses, I find that I am unable to accept the evidence of the Complainant as to the interaction between himself and theSOin the rear yard of the residence, but accept instead that the Complainant had entered the rear yard in order to evade theSOand that he was actively fighting and struggling with theSOin order to prevent his arrest.I further find, based on the evidence ofCW#1, that theSOdid not slam the Complainant into the brick wall thereby injuring the Complainant’s hand, nor did he repeatedly punch the Complainant in the head and side.Based on the evidence of both of the civilian witnesses, I accept that theSOwas struggling to attempt to detain the Complainant, while the Complainant was fighting theSOin an attempt to flee.Furthermore, I accept the evidence of theSOthat the Complainant twice assaulted him, as corroborated by the injuries to theSO’s face.While I find on the evidence ofCW#1 that it was not possible that the Complainant injured his hand when he went up against the brick wall, it is still possible that the Complainant was injured when theSOpulled him down off of the fence. I accept, however, that it is equally plausible that the Complainant injured his hand whenWO#1 andWO#4 pulled him off of the fence at the school, or anytime time in between.I find support for this conclusion based on a number of pieces of evidence, that being: that the Complainant was heard to tell medical staff that he injured his hand “Between the fence”; that he never made any complaint to hospital staff of mistreatment at the hands of police; that despite his assertion that he received the injury earlier at the brick wall, he apparently had no difficulty climbing and jumping at least two fences thereafter; and, in the Complainant’s own statement toSIUinvestigators, his indication that he first felt any pain in his hand when he was atop the fence at the back of the school, where he first realized his left hand was injured and painful.On a review of all of the evidence, I accept the evidence of theSOas to the interaction between himself and the Complainant, as it is substantially confirmed by the evidence of the two independent witnesses, the observations of other police officers, and the injuries to theSO’s face.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are restricted in their use of force to that which is reasonably necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from all of the evidence, and confirmed by the email notifying police of the stolen bicycle, that theSOhad reasonable grounds to arrest the Complainant for being in possession of stolen property contrary to s.354 of theCriminal Code.When the Complainant then entered the rear yard of a residence that he apparently had no connection to in order to evade theSO, he was on that property without permission, and theSOwas entitled to investigate him for trespassing contrary to s.2 of theTrespass to Property Act.After the Complainant began to struggle with theSOin an attempt to evade his arrest, and when he twice struck theSO, theSOagain had reasonable grounds to arrest him for assault resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duties contrary to s. 129 and s. 270 of theCriminal Code.   As such, the apprehension and arrest of the Complainant were legally justified in the circumstancesWith respect to the amount of force used by theSOin his attempts to arrest the Complainant, I find that his behaviour was more than justified in the circumstances and that he used no more force than necessary to attempt to detain the Complainant, who was actively and violently resisting his arrest, and who twice assaulted theSOcausing him injury.On the whole, I find that theSO’s actions progressed to meet the Complainant’s resistance and that, in reality, his actions never reached the level of the Complainant’s, which caused theSO’s injuries and allowed the Complainant to escape.   On the evidence ofCW#1 andCW#2, it is clear that the actions of theSOwere never more than attempting to control and contain the Complainant, and at no time was he seen to punch, kick or strike the Complainant.Furthermore, once theSObegan to get fatigued, I can find no issue with his resort to hisCEWin order to attempt to bring the struggle to an end. Unfortunately, likely due to the Complainant’s ingestion of narcotics, theCEWwas ineffective and the Complainant did not feel the effects of theCEW, allowing him to escape.Finally, while the evidence ofCW#1 specifically contradicts the allegation that the Complainant was injured by theSOthrowing him against a brick wall, the question remains whether or not theSOmay have injured the Complainant when he pulled him off of the fence while trying to prevent his escape.On the evidence, it is as likely, if not more so, that he was only injured later, when he indicated that he first felt pain in his wrist while he was atop the fence, but, even if his injury was caused by theSOwhen he pulled him off of the fence, I cannot find that to amount to an excessive use of force.In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR. v. Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety.On this record, it is clear that theSO, in pulling the Complainant, who had already been arrested, from the fence in order to prevent him escaping lawful custody contrary to s. 145(1)(a) of theCriminal Code, used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances, and possibly less than could have been justified.  On all of the evidence, I am of the opinion that the actions of theSOin attempting to apprehend the Complainant fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to effect his lawful detention.In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the actions resorted to by theSOin his attempts to arrest and detain the Complainant were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered, even were I to find that theSOcaused the injury, which I am not inclined to do.  I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by theSOfell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.Date:	June 22, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=72
,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment Upon arrival at hospital the Complainant indicated that she had pain in her right wrist and x-rays were ordered which revealed that she had a small fragment of bone which projected over the dorsal aspect of the carpal bones suspicious for an acute triquetral fracture,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=70
,Ontario Provincial Police,Kawartha Lakes,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant was transported to the hospital where he was diagnosed as having sustained a right mid-humeral fracture with moderate angulation the arm was placed in a cast,"As a result, numerous police vehicles were dispatched to the scene, with the initial arrival of Subject Officer (SO) #2, Witness Officer (WO) #1 andWO#3, and later followed byWO#2 andWO#4,WO#5 andSO#1.  The Complainant was eventually apprehended and arrested for possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace contrary to s.88 of theCriminal Code.  Following his interaction with police, the Complainant was transported to the hospital by ambulance where he was diagnosed as having sustained a right mid-humeral fracture (the humerus is the long bone in the upper arm) with moderate angulation.Although the Complainant agreed to be interviewed bySIUinvestigators, it is clear from his statement which contained many verifiably impossible fact scenarios, that he was unable to accurately recall his interaction with the police, or what lead up to his interaction, or how he sustained his injury.  On the basis of the many and obvious inaccuracies in the Complainant’s statement, I have not relied on the evidence of the Complainant in formulating my conclusion as to whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant’s injury was caused by an excessive use of force by police.During the course of this investigation, however, in addition to the Complainant, five civilian witnesses (CWs), two special constables from a different police service who were in the area for unrelated reasons, and six police officers were interviewed and provided their memorandum book notes for review.SO#1 declined to be interviewed or to provide his memorandum book notes for review, as was his legal right,SO#2 provided both a statement and his notes.  Additionally, investigators also had access to the in-car camera (ICC) videos from a number of different police cruisers, police radio transmission recordings, 911 call recordings, and the Complainant’s medical records.With the exception of the evidence provided by the Complainant, the statements of all of the other witnesses were both internally and externally consistent, resulting in a clear picture of what occurred.On all of the evidence, it is clear that until the Complainant got down onto the ground and gave up his weapon, although police had been seen by numerous witnesses with their firearms drawn pursuing the Complainant, no officer ever came into physical contact with him; the first physical contact only taking place after the Complainant was already on the ground and was being restrained and handcuffed.Due to the location of the Complainant’s ultimate arrest, it was not seen by anyCWs, with the exception ofCW#1, who observed the Complainant on the ground surrounded by a number of uniformed police officers while being handcuffed.CW#1, however, advised that she did not see how the Complainant came to be on the ground, but she stated that at no time did she observe any police officer use any excessive force towards the Complainant.Further, there is no dispute on the evidence that although numerous police officers were seen with either long guns or their side arms drawn, andWO#2 had herCEWin hand, no use of force option was ever deployed against the Complainant.According toSO#2, after his arrival at the scene he tried to communicate with the Complainant, but the Complainant only looked back at him with a blank stare.  This evidence is confirmed byCW#3 who described the Complainant as having a “dead stare” and a frightening look on his face.SO#2 indicated that the Complainant periodically waved the machete around over his head and that he ordered the Complainant to drop it while at the same time, he tried to reassure the Complainant that the police were not there to hurt him.CW#3 indicated that she heardWO#1 speak to the Complainant and asked him, “Can we talk for a minute”, but that the Complainant did not reply.After the Complainant turned and walked away,SO#2,WO#1,WO#3 andWO#2 followed.  The Complainant finally stopped near a fenced patio connected to a commercial building; he still had the machete in his hand.SO#1 was then seen to drive up and park his cruiser so as to block the Complainant.  WhenSO#1 exited his cruiser, he told the Complainant, “Police, don’t move!” and to drop the machete.  The fact that numerous commands were shouted by various officers to “Drop the knife!” is confirmed byCW#1 and Police Employee Witness #1, whileCW#2 heard the officers yelling, “Get down, get down!”SO#2 stated that he andSO#1 continued to issue commands to the Complainant to drop the machete, and the Complainant finally placed the sheathed machete on the ground and dropped down to his knees.SO#1 then used his foot to ‘thrust’ the Complainant all the way down to the ground, which is confirmed by theICCvideo fromSO#1’s police cruiser whereinSO#1 is seen to contact the Complainant in the back, with his foot, forcing him forward and face down onto the ground.Once the Complainant was fully on the ground,SO#2 shouldered his rifle and the police officers approached the Complainant.SO#2 describedSO#1 on the Complainant’s left side trying to control his left arm, whileSO#2 was on the Complainant’s right side trying to control his right arm;WO#2 andWO#1 were also on the ground trying to control the Complainant, while another police officer thatSO#2 could not identify was holding the Complainant’s legs to prevent him from kicking.  This evidence is confirmed by theICCvideo wherein the police officers are seen to kneel on the ground around and over top of the Complainant, withSO#2 andSO#1 positioned near his upper body,WO#1 near his mid-section,WO#4 near his feet, andWO#2 also standing near his feet.SO#2 indicated that he held the Complainant’s right arm in what he described as an “arm-bar,” which involvedSO#2 using his right arm to control the Complainant’s right elbow and his left hand to control the Complainant’s right wrist, while the Complainant was struggling and trying to pull his arm free andSO#2 was repeatedly telling the Complainant to stop resisting.SO#2 described the Complainant as then abruptly pulling his arm away, at which pointSO#2 heard a pop from the Complainant’s right shoulder and the Complainant completely stopped struggling and did not resist any further.  He was then handcuffed andEMSwere contacted to attend.WO#4 indicated that asSO#2 was trying to pull the Complainant’s arms behind his back for handcuffing, the Complainant was resisting and struggling and would not allow the police officers to gain physical control of him.WO#5 described the Complainant as face down on the ground with his hands not yet cuffed, and being agitated, confused, and uncooperative, in that he was yelling and struggling with the police.WO#5 advised that he heard the police officers collectively trying to calm and reassure the Complainant, and he describedSO#2,SO#1,WO#4 andWO#1 as all being physically engaged with the Complainant, withSO#2 on top of the Complainant’s mid-section holding him down, while the other police officers were somewhere below the Complainant’s shoulders.WO#5 then took control of the Complainant’s head and neck as the Complainant was moving to and fro, and placed his knee on the Complainant’s left shoulder.WO#1 indicated that asSO#2 andSO#1 were trying to handcuff the Complainant behind his back, the Complainant resisted and tried to flip over onto his back, at which point she heard a loud “pop”.WO#2 describedSO#2 andSO#1 as being busy trying to get the Complainant’s hands behind his back to be handcuffed while the Complainant was struggling and trying to get away.WO#2 described the Complainant as strong, since bothSO#2 andSO#1 together had to struggle to handcuff him, and that it took a concerted effort to get the Complainant into handcuffs.WO#2 advised that afterSO#2 had requestedEMSassistance, he told her that he had heard a pop from the Complainant’s shoulder, and he thought the shoulder may have become dislocated.The evidence of all of the police officers present for the arrest of the Complainant is consistent in that all indicated that no use of force options were ever deployed, nor was the Complainant ever punched, kicked, or struck in anyway, with the interaction being described as a struggle to control and handcuff him.On all of the evidence, I accept that whileSO#2 andSO#1 were trying to pull the Complainant’s hands behind his back, a ‘pop’ was heard, and that at that point the Complainant fractured his right humerus.  I further accept, there being no reliable evidence to the contrary, that no use of force options were resorted to, nor was the Complainant ever struck, punched, or kicked by any police officer.  The question that remains, then, is whether or not the actions ofSO#1, in using his foot to push the Complainant to the ground by putting his foot on the Complainant’s back, or the actions of bothSO#2 andSO#1, in struggling to control the Complainant and pulling his hands behind his back for handcuffing, amounted to an excessive use of force in the circumstances.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are restricted in their use of force to that which is reasonably necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear on the evidence of all of the independentCWs, as well as the police witnesses, that the Complainant was, at the very least, a danger to the public in that he was wielding a machete and waving it around in a public area which was well populated at that time of day by pedestrians and that, as such, he had the potential to cause serious injury.  It is clear on this evidence that police had ample grounds to arrest the Complainant for possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace contrary to s. 88 of theCriminal Codeand that the resultant pursuit and apprehension of the Complainant was legally justified in the circumstances.With respect to the amount of force resorted to by police, dealing first withSO#1’s pushing the Complainant to the ground with his foot in his back, I cannot find this to be an excessive use of force in these circumstances.  While the Complainant appeared to be getting to his knees on his own at the time, he still had the machete within arm’s reach and continued to pose a danger to both the police officers and the public until he was fully restrained and disarmed.  In these circumstances, where the Complainant had already led the police in a foot pursuit through a busy parking lot while waving around a machete and ignoring all police commands to drop the weapon, I cannot find thatSO#1’s actions amounted to an excessive use of force.On all of the evidence, it is clear that there was some urgency to apprehend and restrain the Complainant before he could have again got his hands on the machete.  Furthermore, it would not have been wise forSO#1 to get any closer to the Complainant until the weapon was fully out of reach and he was ‘incapacitated’, and therefore, his resorting to his foot to push the Complainant to the ground was more than reasonable in the circumstances.  In the final analysis, of course, it is clear that this was not the source of the Complainant’s injury.While I accept that the Complainant sustained the fracture to his right humerus during the course ofSO#1 andSO#2 attempting to handcuff him behind his back, while he was actively struggling and resisting, I find that pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, the police officers involved used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the execution of their lawful duties.  In coming to this conclusion, I am mindful of the state of the law as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada inR v Nasogaluak[2010] 1 S.C.R. 206, as follows:Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained inR. v. Bottrell(1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. They should have been directed that the appellant could not be expected to measure the force used with exactitude. [p. 218]Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal inR. v. Baxter(1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety. I find that the degree of force applied by the two police officers in their attempts to handcuff the Complainant was directly proportionate to the amount of resistance that he was offering up and that it was neither expected nor foreseeable that struggling with the Complainant to attempt to gain control of his hands for handcuffing could lead to the fracture of his humerus.On this record, and in these circumstances, it is clear that the force used bySO#1 andSO#2, and the other police officers involved in the arresting and handcuffing of the Complainant, fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to effect his lawful detention and to remove the risk that he continued to pose until he was properly restrained and handcuffed.  As such, on this evidence, I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe that either police officer resorted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances, and there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges.Date:	June 20, 2018Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=68

,Guelph Police Service,Guelph,Ontario,The medical records indicated that “the only significant sic is trauma to the head which has resulted in a concussion and whiplash injury as well as trauma to the front of the mouth for which he had a tooth dislodged and had a quite serious avulsion of his lip which caused some bleeding,"Numerous police officers responded to the call for all units and flooded the area looking for the Jetta involved.At 10:29 a.m., a second dispatch went out to all available units alerting them of a robbery in progress at theRBCat 987 Gordon Street in the City of Guelph.  The dispatch again outlined two men as being involved, and that those two men had ordered everyone in the bank to the floor and threatened to kill people if the funds delivered to the robbers had dye packs.  The men were further described as wearing black masks and black bandanas and had indicated that they had guns and were prepared to shoot people.  The involved motor vehicle at this second robbery was described as a white four door Volkswagen Jetta which was last seen travelling southbound on Gordon Street.Within seconds, the police transmissions communication recording reveals an officer calling in to dispatch and advising that “the Jetta is southbound Gordon, passed me, three males in vehicle”.  He then provides a partial licence plate.While a second officer is heard to indicate that he is going to try and head the vehicle off, theSOis then heard to interrupt, indicating “just passed me … didn’t get the plate … heading southbound lane two” and he then goes on to give a very brief description of the driver when he shouts out that the car just went into the plaza, struck a sign, and “bailed.”  He further indicated that two of the occupants were still in the car and one was running.From theSO’s first sighting of the suspect vehicle, until his reporting that it had struck the pole, no more than 12 seconds had elapsed.Upon arrival of the police, a second occupant of the vehicle was just exiting the vehicle to flee when he was apprehended, leaving behind only the Complainant, who was seated in the rear passenger seat of the Jetta.  The Complainant was transported to hospital where he remained for eight days.  The discharge summary in his medical records concludes that he suffered a concussion, possible whiplash, an avulsion (a part was torn away) of his lip, and he had lost a tooth.While the Complainant declined to provide theSIUwith a statement, the driver of the Jetta and the second passenger both consented to being interviewed.According toCW#1, he was the driver of the Jetta at the time of the collision but had no knowledge as to the owner of the vehicle or the identity of either of his passengers.CW#1 recalled being involved in a collision, but not what he collided with, how the collision occurred, the speed at which he was driving at the time, or if anyone was behind him.CW#1 professed that he did not hear any sirens, nor did he see any emergency lights, and he was unaware that the police were following him.CW#1 did recall opening the door of the car in order to flee, after looking in the back seat and seeing a male who was passed out or knocked out and bleeding.  He also recalled a police officer (theSO) then pointing his firearm atCW#1, pulling him from the vehicle, placing him face down on the ground, and then handcuffing him.CW#1 indicated that no use of force was employed against him and that theSOtreated him well.CW#4, the second passenger in the Jetta, said that he was seated in the left rear seat while the Complainant was seated to his right.CW#4 stated that the Complainant had recently, prior to this date, broken a front tooth and had received a replacement (as the Complainant did not provide a statement, it is unclear whether or not this is the tooth that is indicated in the medical records as having been lost during the collision).CW#4 indicated thatCW#1 was driving in the centre lane when he alerted the two rear seat passengers of the presence of police and they saw one police cruiser suddenly come up behind them with its lights and sirens activated.CW#4 also observed a second police cruiser about 30 metres back also with its emergency lighting activated.  According toCW#4,CW#1 then applied his brakes and turned to the right into a car repair shop, where he spun out and struck a pole.CW#4 estimated that the collision occurred approximately ten seconds after he first heard the police siren.  After the collision,CW#4 looked behind them and saw multiple police cruisers present, and he got out of the car and ran away, leaving his two co-passengers behind.CW#4 indicated that he was apprehended shortly thereafter at gunpoint, but no force was used against him, nor did police do anything harmful to his co-passengers in the car.CW#4 opined thatCW#1 panicked when he saw the police, which is why he collided with the pole.Of the four independent civilian witnesses who were interviewed, all of whom heard and saw the collision as it was occurring, none described the incident as involving a police pursuit, with each apparently believing that this was simply a collision without any police involvement.  Of those witnesses,CW#5, who observed the actual collision with the Jetta striking the commercial sign, estimated that theSOarrived at the scene some ten seconds after the collision, with lights and siren activated, whileCW#3, who observed the Jetta heading across the parking lot seemingly out of control and then hitting the curb and a rigid sign, advised that he observed the first police vehicle arrive within five seconds of the collision.Additionally, each of the four independent civilian witnesses described the Complainant as resisting and struggling when he was removed from the vehicle, with one witness describing the Complainant as trying to kick at the police officers, while a second witness described the Complainant as swearing the entire time that it took to handcuff him, some 15 minutes in total, due to his ongoing resistance and refusal to put his hands behind his back.CW#1 described three police officers trying to put the handcuffs on the Complainant and continuously yelling at the Complainant to “stop resisting”.  This evidence is consistent with that of the officers involved in the arrest of the Complainant.TheSOadvised that after hearing the dispatch regarding the attempted robbery at the Scotia Bank, he attended that location and viewed the photos of the suspect vehicle taken by the witness.  As he was leaving the Scotia Bank, he heard the dispatch about the robbery in progress at theRBCand he activated his emergency lights and siren and headed in that direction.  Further information received from officers who had spoken to witnesses at theRBCconfirmed that it was the same suspect vehicle involved, and that the suspects had yelled that they would shoot people, and also that all persons in the bank had been ordered to get on the ground.TheSOinitially observed a white Jetta, which he thought might be the suspect vehicle, pulled over to the side for his cruiser, but after taking a closer look, noted that it did not have the same distinctive features that had been referred to by dispatch.  He then made a U-turn to return southbound on Gordon Street, when he observed the suspect vehicle ahead and decided to perform a traffic stop.  At that point, he activated his sirens and observed the suspect vehicle pass Heritage Drive and then abruptly turn right in an attempt to drive into a plaza, when the front end of the Jetta lifted off the roadway and he thought the vehicle had struck a pole. TheSOthen drove in behind the crashed Jetta.On all of the evidence, as between both the occupants of the suspect vehicle and the independent civilian witnesses, as well as all police witnesses, there is no dispute that the Complainant sustained his injuries as a result of the motor vehicle collision and the fact that he was not wearing his seatbelt at the time.There is no allegation that any police officer used any unnecessary force as against the Complainant and it is not in dispute that his injuries had already been sustained prior to his first police contact and before he was removed from the vehicle, and that a minimal amount of force was used to hold the Complainant down when he was combative and struggling, and thereafter to handcuff him.Furthermore, based on the evidence from the 911 calls, as confirmed by each of the police officers who attended the respective banks, there is no question that the police had ample grounds upon which to stop and arrest the occupants of the suspect vehicle for the bank robbery and the initial attempted bank robbery.With respect to theSO’s actions in attempting to perform a vehicle stop on the Jetta being driven byCW#1, if one accepts the evidence ofCW#1 that he had no inkling that police were behind him, then it is clear that nothing that theSOdid contributed to the collision and subsequent injuries to the Complainant, asCW#1 apparently crashed the Jetta for reasons totally unrelated to anything that theSOwas doing.Unfortunately, the evidence ofCW#4 directly contradicts the assertion byCW#1 that he was unaware of the police behind him, asCW#4 indicated that it wasCW#1 who alerted the others in the car of the presence of the police vehicle behind them, following which he appeared to panic and crashed the car.Even ifCW#1 crashed the car as a result of seeing theSO’s police cruiser behind him, with lights and sirens activated, and then panicking, I am still unable to find any evidence to support a finding that theSOwas engaged in a police pursuit.  Clearly, in the time between when theSOfirst saw the suspect vehicle, which was a distance ahead, and the time of the crash, some 12 seconds later, there would scarcely have been sufficient time for him to engage in a pursuit, as he had not yet even caught up to the vehicle, which was not travelling particularly quickly (between 60-70 km/h).Pursuant to Ontario Regulation 266/10 of the OntarioPolice Services Actentitled Suspect Apprehension Pursuits,s. 2(1) A police officer may pursue, or continue to pursue, a fleeing motor vehicle that fails to stop,(a)	if the police officer has reason to believe that a criminal offence has been committed or is about to be committed; or(b)	for the purposes of motor vehicle identification or the identification of an individual in the vehicle.As such, since theSOclearly had reason to believe that the occupants of the suspect Volkswagen Jetta had just committed a serious criminal offence, he would have been justified in engaging the vehicle in a pursuit, had it failed to stop when directed to do so.However, on these facts, it appears that theSOnever had to make that decision, as he was still at the point wherein he was hoping to perform a vehicle stop when the suspect vehicle crashed.  Pursuant to the legislation, ‘a suspect apprehension pursuit occurs when a police officer attempts to direct the driver of a motor vehicle to stop, the driver refuses to obey the officer and the officer pursues in a motor vehicle for the purpose of stopping the fleeing motor vehicle’.  It is clear that since at no time did theSOhave the opportunity to direct the Jetta to stop, as it was still some distance ahead of him when he first spotted it, that the driver never refused to obey the officer, and as such there was no pursuit.Furthermore, even if the actions of theSOcould be tortured to fit within the definition of vehicle pursuit, its duration would have been less than 12 seconds, as the communications recording clearly indicates that from the time that theSOfirst spotted the Jetta until it crashed into the pole in the plaza, no more than 12 seconds had elapsed.As indicated, however, I can find no evidence to conclude that theSOever engaged the Jetta in a vehicular pursuit for the following reasons:CW#1’s indication that police did not influence his driving;CW#4 advised that as soon asCW#1 saw the police cars behind him, he immediately lost control of the vehicle and crashed;Of the four independent civilian witnesses present, none heard a siren or observed a police vehicle at the time thatCW#1 crashed the car, and none appeared to be of the view that there was actually a police pursuit in progress;The evidence of both ofCW#1 andCW#4 at no time made any mention of their belief that they were involved in a police pursuit;As theSOwas radioing in that he had spotted the suspect vehicle, and began to describe the driver, he suddenly stopped and shouted that the car had crashed.  During this radio transmission, no sirens could be heard in the background; andTwo of the civilian witnesses indicated that the first police vehicle that arrived at the scene, did not arrive until some five to ten seconds after the collision.Therefore, on the undisputed evidence, it appears clear that theSO, who was in possession of information that the white Volkswagen Jetta he observed ahead had just been involved in a bank robbery where firearms had been threatened, turned on his emergency equipment in order to conduct a vehicle stop in order to investigate the occupants of the suspect vehicle, when the vehicle almost immediately mounted the curb and crashed into the pole causing the Complainant’s injuries.  As such, I can find no causal connection between the actions of theSOand the injuries to the Complainant, nor can I find that the actions of theSOare open to any criticism, as it is clear that he was doing exactly as the law, and his duties, required him to do in these circumstances.On these facts, I can find no criminal charge which would be even remotely relevant for consideration on these facts.  With respect to either dangerous driving causing bodily harm, or criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the evidence reveals neither a causal connection between the actions of theSOand the subsequent collision and injuries to the Complainant, nor any actions by theSOthat could possibly fall outside the limits of the criminal law.  Therefore, as I lack the grounds for the laying of any criminal charges, none shall issue.In concluding, however, I wish to make note of the efficient and professional behaviour of the members of theGPSin their concerted effort to apprehend the alleged bank robbers.  Their behaviour, which involved the use of a very minimal amount of force, in the successful apprehension of these parties was commendable in the circumstances and should be a standard towards which all police services strive.Date:	June 27, 2018Original signed byTony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=46
,Peterborough Police Service,Peterborough,Ontario,nNature of Injuries  Treatment The Complainant had his nose x-rayed which confirmed a minimally displaced nasal bone fracture,,https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=117
,Toronto Police Service,Dufferin,Ontario,The Complainant was then taken to the hospital and diagnosed with several fractures to his spine,"During the course of this investigation, four civilian witnesses, including the Complainant, and five police witnesses were interviewed, including the subject officer (SO); additionally, investigators had access to the notebooks of seven police officers, the radio transmissions recordings, surveillance video from two commercial premises along the route travelled by the Complainant and the police cruiser, the in-car camera (ICC) video from the police cruiser, the download data from both the police cruiser and the Complainant’s motor vehicle, and the paramedic and medical records of the Complainant.  During the course of my analysis, I have broken down the evidence into two distinct portions: the evidence leading up to the single vehicle collision between the Complainant’s motor vehicle and theTPL, and the conduct of police during the arrest of the Complainant.1.	 The CollisionThe Complainant, in his statement toSIUinvestigators, advised that on May 11th, 2017, he was involved in a single vehicle motor vehicle collision with theTPL, during which he struck his head and may have been injured.  Following the collision, the Complainant then ran and hid in a laneway in a stairwell.In both the paramedic and the hospital records of the Complainant, he advised medical personnel that he had “passed out” or “blanked out” as a result of which he had crashed; the Complainant does not repeat that assertion in his statement toSIUinvestigators.  Also, in his paramedic records, the paramedics have recorded that the “patient does not recall if he had his seatbelt on.” The Complainant’s assertion in his statement toSIUinvestigators that he was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the collision appears to be contradicted not only by his comment to paramedics, but also by his own statement wherein he advised that he struck his head during the collision.  The download data from the vehicle driven by the Complainant positively confirmed that the Complainant was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the collision.The download data from the Chevrolet Cruze driven by the Complainant also revealed that five seconds prior to mounting the curb surrounding the library, the Complainant was driving at 140 km/h at a location of approximately 136 metres north of the intersection where the library is located.  In the final five seconds prior to impact, the Complainant applied his brakes and had decreased his speed to about 58 km/h by the time his vehicle mounted the curb, and he had further reduced his speed to 32 km/h when he struck the building; this evidence would appear to contradict the Complainant’s claim to medical personnel that he had passed out, as he was clearly and heavily applying the brakes just prior to striking the library.The Automatic Vehicle Locator (AVL) data from the police cruiser driven by theSOrevealed that the police vehicle had been continuously operated at speeds of less than 40 km/h before theSOspotted the Complainant’s motor vehicle.  As theSOwas driving westbound on Lappin Avenue at 3:54 a.m., he was driving at approximately 24 km/h; after he made his U-turn, he travelled eastbound on Lappin towards Dufferin Street at speeds which had increased to range between 54 and 64 km/h.  At 3:55 a.m., the police cruiser was travelling southbound on Gladstone Avenue for a distance of about 325 metres, in the wrong direction on a now one-way street, at a speed of approximately 82 km/h.TheICCvideo from theSO’s cruiser, once activated, revealed that the Complainant’s motor vehicle was only visible to the occupants of the police cruiser after it had already collided with the library building, theICCnot having been activated in time to record the original sighting of the motor vehicle.The police transmission recordings indicate that theSOandWO#1 advised that they were at the collision scene at 3:56:30 a.m., they had located the Complainant in a laneway at 3:58:43 a.m., and at 4:01:31 a.m. an ambulance was requested.Surveillance video from a convenience store at the intersection of Lappin Avenue and Dufferin Street revealed theSO’s cruiser travelling slowly westbound on Lappin Avenue and then out of view.  Seen next is the Complainant’s motor vehicle travelling eastbound on Lappin Avenue, at what appears to be a high rate of speed, turn right from eastbound Lappin Avenue to southbound Dufferin Street, without stopping at the stop sign, and moving directly into the path of another motor vehicle, causing that vehicle to brake to avoid a collision.   This evidence contradicts the Complainant’s assertion that he had stopped at the stop sign when he first noticed that the police cruiser had made a U-turn.TheSO’s cruiser is recorded as then following westbound on Lappin Avenue approximately eight seconds behind the Chevrolet Cruze, after having accelerated to the same rate of speed as the Chevrolet Cruze but without any emergency lighting activated.  The police cruiser is then seen another eight seconds later also turning right onto Dufferin Street without stopping at the stop sign; the emergency lighting system was still not activated.The Chevrolet Cruze is next picked up by the surveillance video from a Tim Hortons store located directly across the street from theTPL, where, at 3:55:34 a.m., the Chevrolet Cruze is seen travelling at a high rate of speed southbound on Gladstone Avenue, going through the stop sign at the intersection of Gladstone Avenue and Bloor Street West, and colliding with the exterior wall of the library on the south side of Bloor Street West. Twenty one seconds later, theSO’s police cruiser is seen driving southbound on Gladstone Avenue and arriving at the intersection with Bloor Street West; the cruiser is driving at a normal rate of speed and does not have its emergency lighting equipment activated.While both of theSOandWO#1, in their respective statements, advised that at no time were they engaged in a police pursuit with the Complainant, I have not repeated their evidence here, as it is fully consistent with, and confirmed by, the various technical and video evidence obtained by investigators, which has already been outlined above.2.	 The Conduct of Police at ArrestIt is alleged that while the Complainant was hiding in the stairwell, five uniformed police officers arrived and all had their firearms drawn and were shouting at the Complainant to put his hands up and not move or they would shoot him.  A police officer then came down the stairwell and hit the Complainant four to five times, slapping him on the side of his face, after which the police officer used his fist or open hand to hit him in his back and rib area on the right side of his body.  It is alleged that after the Complainant was struck, he could no longer walk on his own.The Complainant was then transported to hospital by ambulance.  The Complainant was diagnosed with a broken bone in his back; he had no injuries prior to this incident.While the medical and paramedic records have no notation as to what the Complainant may have said as to how he suffered his injury, throughout the records, the mechanism of his injury is recorded as being a motor vehicle collision; at no time is there any notation that the Complainant made any complaint that he received his injury, or that he was assaulted, at the hands of police.  Additionally, the records indicate that there are no abrasions, bruises, lacerations or other external injuries located in the area of his spinal injury, which one would have expected had he been struck or punched by police with such a degree of force as would have caused his injury, as is alleged.According to a medical expert opinion received, the injury sustained by the Complainant, that being a fracture to his L2 vertebral body, is a severe injury typically associated with high speed or high velocity and/or energy mechanisms and is a common injury seen following a motor vehicle collision.  The expert further advised that although this injury can also be caused by a fall from height or severe blunt force trauma, in these circumstances, the Complainant’s injury was most likely caused by the vehicle collision and not by any subsequent altercation.Two civilian witnesses, who both heard the Complainant’s interaction with police, described the arrest as not involving any physical altercation, or a violent dispute, and no slapping or hitting sounds were heard.  The first witness advised that she initially heard a person running and, when she looked out, she saw two police officers running in the alley at the back of her apartment building.  She then heard some scuffling and that the police officers were speaking with someone, but no indications of a physical interaction, only that the police officers were trying to apprehend someone.  She then heard a voice say, “You hit my back! My back is broken!” and described the voice as screaming and moaning and that it seemed to her that the person was being overly dramatic, or over the top.  The witness later saw the Complainant walk to the ambulance with the police officers and she observed him to be walking on his own and not being dragged by police, although he was screaming throughout.  The witness observed that there were only three police officers with the Complainant and she was able to describe each of them.The witness also overheard the Complainant tell paramedics that he had received his injuries in a “crash”.Another witness heard two or three police officers speaking in an authoritative tone telling someone to “Stop.  Just stop moving,” and advised that they sounded exasperated.  One police officer was observed standing in the centre of the courtyard.  The witness then heard someone say, in an exaggerated manner, “Ohhh my back,” and a police officer responded, “Come out from there,” to which the person responded, “I can’t move.  I can’t move.”  A police officer then stated, “You got yourself down there, you can get yourself back up.”The witness observed a police officer then escort the Complainant out of the courtyard.  The Complainant was observed as walking normally and it did not appear that his back was broken.  Occasionally the Complainant would complain, “Oh my leg.  Oh now my back.  Oh no,” which was described as sounding almost comical and not like he was in pain.  This second witness also confirmed that she heard no sounds from the stairwell that she would attribute to an altercation between the Complainant and the police officers.I find it of particular note that both of the independent civilian witnesses described the Complainant as being overly dramatic or comical when he loudly and repeatedly complained about his injuries, which I take as meaning that he was putting on a show and was not being sincere in his complaints.TheSO, in his statement, advised that the Complainant’s motor vehicle initially came to his attention when it made an abrupt turn onto Lappin Avenue and entered into the oncoming lane of traffic, where the police cruiser was travelling at the time.  TheSOadvised that the Complainant then quickly adjusted his driving and the motor vehicle returned to the proper lane. TheSOmade note of the licence plate number, following which he made a U-turn and followed.  TheSOindicated that his initial intention was only to follow the Chevrolet Cruze from a distance and he observed the Complainant drop off his passenger, following which he drove off at a higher rate of speed.  The Complainant then failed to stop at a stop sign.  Based on the various driving infractions of the Complainant to that point, theSOdecided he would conduct a vehicle stop under theHighway Traffic Act(HTA) and increased his speed to follow.  TheSOadvised that once the Complainant turned onto Dufferin Street, he lost sight of him.  TheSOalso advised that at no time did he activate his emergency lighting system or siren.  Once theSOarrived at the stop sign on Gladstone Avenue and Hallam Street, he observed the Complainant driving at a high rate of speed southbound on Gladstone Avenue, already some 300 to 350 metres ahead of where the police cruiser was stopped in the intersection.TheSOadvised that he drove southbound on Gladstone, in excess of the speed limit, and that he also travelled the wrong way on Gladstone, when it changed to a one-way street, of which he was unaware at the time.  TheSOadvised that he observed no pedestrian traffic.  TheSOthen transmitted over his radio asking if there were any other cruisers in the area, but received no response.  When the distance between his own vehicle and the Complainant’s increased to about 400 metres, theSOrealized he was not going to catch up to the vehicle, and he provided the dispatcher with the make, colour and licence plate of the motor vehicle, while it disappeared from his view.WO#1 advised that he believed that the Complainant was unaware of the police cruiser at that point because they were so far behind and they had not activated any emergency equipment.When theSOarrived at the intersection of Gladstone and Bloor Street West, he observed that the Complainant had crashed into the side of the library.  TheSOthen turned left onto Bloor Street West, without coming to a complete stop at the stop sign, and then again re-entered Gladstone Avenue when it continued on south of Bloor Street; his speed at that point was between 20 and 30 km/h.  TheSOthen observed the Complainant running southbound, and he followed in his cruiser, but lost sight of the Complainant.  TheSOeventually stopped his cruiser and continued to look for the Complainant on foot whileWO#1 took over driving.  A number of pedestrians, and then a delivery man, pointed theSOin the direction in which the Complainant had run, eventually leading him to a laneway between buildings.  When theSOshone his flashlight down a staircase, he observed two stationary feet, which appeared to be hiding, and he backed up and used his radio to adviseWO#1 of his location.WO#1 advised that upon his arrival, he observed the Complainant with both his hands in the air and he was crying that his back was broken.WO#1 and theSOboth then commanded the Complainant to get on the ground, but he said he was unable to do so as his back was broken.  Both police officers walked toward the staircase and theSOdrew his firearm, as he did not know whether or not the Complainant was armed, and he shone his flashlight at the Complainant and stated, “Police, don’t move.”  TheSOdescribed the Complainant as out of breath, shaking like a leaf, and appearing defeated; he complained that he was in pain and required an ambulance.  TheSOthen re-holstered his firearm and waited for other officers to arrive.  Shortly thereafter, additional officers arrived and theSOwent down to assist the Complainant to stand up.  TheSOasked the Complainant what hurt and the Complainant responded that it was his back, following which theSOandWO#1 assisted the Complainant up the stairs with each holding one of his arms and supporting him.  While they went up the stairs, theSOrecalled the Complainant stating, “I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  I fucked up.  I’m not supposed to be driving.  I think I fucked up my back.”  TheSOthen arrested him for dangerous driving. TheSOadvised that neither he, nor any other police officer present, ever struck the Complainant, nor did the Complainant ever complain that theSOhad injured him.WO#4 advised that when he arrived at the arrest scene, he observed both of theSOandWO#1 standing at the top of a staircase and he saw the Complainant crouched at the bottom yelling that he needed an ambulance and complaining about his back.WO#4 advised that he observed theSOandWO#1 hold the Complainant under his armpits and walk him out of the stairwell, just as he was leaving to search the area.WO#4 advised that he at no time had any physical contact with the Complainant.WO#3 advised that the arrest of the Complainant was a simple one, and that no fight occurred, and he had no physical contact with the Complainant.Pursuant to section 25(1) of theCriminal Code, police officers are restricted in their use of force to that which is reasonably necessary in the execution of a lawful duty.  Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from all of the evidence, and as conceded by the Complainant in his statement, that when he came to the attention of police, rather than slow or pull over, he decided to accelerate and speed off.  Additionally, it is clear from the surveillance video and the download data from his motor vehicle that he failed to stop at a number of controlled intersections, that he interfered with other traffic in doing so, and that he was driving at excessive rates of speed.  As such, theSOwas legally entitled to stop and investigate the Complainant not only forHTAinfractions, but to simply confirm that he was a licensed driver, and that his vehicle was properly insured.  Pursuant to s.216 of theHTAand the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Ladouceur, [1990], 1 S.C.R. 1257, police can legally stop any motor vehicle to check the driver’s licence and insurance, the driver’s sobriety, or the mechanical fitness of the vehicle, and these random stops do not offend theCanadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  As such, police were acting lawfully when they attempted to initially stop and investigate the Complainant pursuant to theHTA.  Furthermore, when he then increased his rate of speed, ran several stop signs, and ultimately crashed into the side of the library, they had further grounds to arrest him for dangerous driving contrary to theCriminal Codeas well.On the evidence before me, I find that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant’s injury was caused by the motor vehicle collision based on the following evidence:  the expert medical opinion as to the mechanism of his injury; the comments made by the Complainant, as overheard by an independent civilian witness, that he had sustained his injury as a result of being involved in a “crash”; and, the fact that the medical assessment of the Complainant did not uncover any bruises, contusions or abrasions consistent with his having been punched or struck, as is alleged.  On all of the evidence, I have no hesitation in accepting that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant’s injury was as a direct result of his smashing his motor vehicle into the library wall decelerating from a high rate of speed while not wearing a seatbelt, and that it is not consistent with his having been punched or struck with an open hand by a police officer at the time of his arrest.Furthermore, on this record, I find that the evidence as provided in the statements of both of theSOandWO#1 is fully confirmed by theICCvideo and theAVLdata from the police cruiser, the download data from the vehicle driven by the Complainant, the police radio transmission recordings, and the surveillance video from the two commercial premises on the route followed by the Complainant; on this basis, I accept their evidence in its entirety as being an accurate recounting of the sequence of events and reject the evidence of the Complainant where it is contradicted by the evidence of the police officers.Dealing then with whether or not the Complainant’s crash into theTPLand his subsequent injuries were as a result of a police pursuit initiated by theSO, and, whether or not there was a pursuit, if there are reasonable grounds to believe that theSOcommitted a criminal offence, specifically, whether or not his driving leading up to the collision was dangerous and therefore in contravention of s.249 (1) of theCriminal Codeand did thereby cause bodily harm contrary to s.249 (3).The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada R. v. Beatty, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49, is authority that s.249 requires that the impugned driving be dangerous to the public, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that, at the time, is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place, and the driving must be such that it amounts to “a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances”.On a review of all of the evidence, I accept the evidence of both of theSOandWO#1 that theSOat no time engaged the Complainant in a police pursuit.  I accept this version of events not only because it is confirmed by all of the physical evidence as outlined above, but also because the Complainant at no time alleged that the police engaged him in a pursuit; other than when the cruiser made a U-turn and accelerated to catch up to the Complainant at the beginning of the incident.  The Complainant does not indicate that he ever even saw the police cruiser again before he collided with the library.  Furthermore, I note that theSOat no time activated any of his emergency equipment and, as soon as he saw that he could not safely catch up to the Complainant, he gave up any attempt at a vehicle stop but instead strategically followed the route he believed the Complainant had taken, at a much lesser rate of speed, after having lost sight of the Complainant’s motor vehicle.  He also advised the dispatcher of the description and last location of the Complainant’s motor vehicle.While theSOconcedes, as is confirmed by the data from his police cruiser, that he exceeded the speed limit initially in his efforts to catch up to the Complainant in order to initiate a vehicle stop, that he drove briefly the wrong way on a one way street, and that he failed to stop at two stop signs, I cannot find that his driving rose to the level as contemplated pursuant to s. 249 of theCriminal Codeas being ‘a marked departure from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances’, those circumstances being a police officer attempting to follow a motor vehicle after it had committed severalHTAinfractions.  While theSO’s speeds were above the posted speed limits in the area, they never exceeded 82 km/h, and that was only for a distance of some 325 metres, while the remainder of his driving during the relevant time frame did not exceed 64 km/h.  Furthermore, I find that there is no evidence that theSO’s driving created a danger to other users of the roadway in that at no time did he interfere with any other traffic, there being very little vehicular or pedestrian traffic at that time of the morning, and the entire route for which he attempted to follow the Complainant was comprised of no more than a distance of 1.5 kms and less than 90 seconds; additionally, the environmental conditions were good and the roads were dry.  TheSOalso did nothing to exacerbate the Complainant’s pattern of dangerous driving, as it appears that due to the distance between the police cruiser and the Complainant, and the fact that theSOdid not activate his emergency equipment, the Complainant was unaware that the police cruiser was still following his route after it had made its original U-turn and accelerated in an attempt to make a traffic stop. In the final analysis, I am satisfied on this record that theSOwas acting lawfully when he first attempted to stop the Complainant to investigate a number ofHTAoffences and that his conduct thereafter fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law.  Accordingly, I am of the opinion that there are no grounds for proceeding with any driving related charges against theSO.With respect to the allegation that one of five police officers, the tall one, hit the Complainant four to five times with an open palm to the right side of his face and then used his fist or open hand to hit the Complainant in his back and rib area, I find that I am unable to place much reliance on the statement of the Complainant for the following reasons:  his statement that he was wearing his seatbelt at the time of the crash has clearly been proven to be untrue based on the data from his motor vehicle; his initial statement to paramedics and medical personnel that he had crashed because he had ‘passed out’ is contradicted both by his later statement toSIUinvestigators and by the fact that he applied the brakes immediately prior to, and right up to, the time of the crash; his comment at the scene, as overheard by a civilian witness, that his injury was caused by “the crash”; the complete absence of any bruising or external injury consistent with his having been punched with such force as to cause his injury; the observations of the two independent civilian witnesses that they heard no sounds which they would have found to be consistent with a physical altercation; the observations of the two civilian witnesses that only three police officers were present at the time the Complainant was removed from the stairwell (which I infer on the evidence to have been theSO,WO#1 andWO#3,WO#4 having gone to walk the route to see if the Complainant had disposed of any items); the observations of the two independent civilian witnesses that the Complainant was being overly dramatic or comical in his ‘over the top’ performance at the scene; and finally, the fact that the Complainant is unable to differentiate between an open handed strike and a punch, when he described the strikes to his body which he believed caused his significant back injury.For all of these reasons, and because the statements of theSOandWO#1 were corroborated and confirmed by all of the evidence other than the Complainant’s, I accept on reasonable grounds the version of events as outlined by the two police officers and reject the version of events as outlined by the Complainant.  On this basis, I cannot find reasonable grounds to find that any officer used any more force against the Complainant other than the minimal required to assist him up the stairs, and that the officers specifically forewent the requirement even of the minimal use of force to handcuff the Complainant, due to the nature of his injury and his complaints.In conclusion, on this record, I find that at no time did theSOengage the Complainant in a police pursuit, that his driving did not rise to the level of being dangerous in the circumstances, and that no police officer resorted to an excessive use of force in apprehending the Complainant.  I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Complainant was injured when he drove into the wall of theTPLwhile driving at excessive rates of speed, in a reckless manner, and while not restrained by his seatbelt, in efforts to evade police.  I further find that the Complainant then fled on foot and was later located hiding in a stairwell, where he was assisted out by police and arrested, and that no more than the absolute minimal use of force was resorted to by any of the officers present.  I find therefore on reasonable grounds that I am unable to form the belief that theSO, or any police officer present for the arrest of the Complainant, committed any criminal offence.Date:	March 13, 2018Tony LoparcoDirectorSpecial Investigations Unit",https://www.siu.on.ca/en/directors_report_details.php?drid=48
