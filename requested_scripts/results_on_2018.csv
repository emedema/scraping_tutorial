2017,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,The Post-Mortem Report which the SIU received on October 2 2018 determined the cause of death to be a gunshot wound to the left chest,"I find, therefore, on this record, that the three shots that were fired by the SO, which struck and killed the Complainant, were justified pursuant to ss.25 (1) and (3) of the Criminal Code and that the SO, in preserving both himself and WO #3, WO #2, and WO #4, from death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant, used no more force than was necessary to effect his lawful purpose. As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO, despite the tragic loss of life, fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ofd-379
2017,Ottawa Police Service,Ottawa,Ontario,The Complainant suffered a fracture of the third vertebra C3 in his neck and was still in hospital with some paralysis in his right arm and both legs at the time of the writing of this report,"In conclusion, on the evidence before me, I find that I lack the reasonable grounds upon which I can be satisfied that the SO’s driving conduct amounted to a criminal offence and therefore no charges shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-295
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,There are no additional facial bone fractures,"In conclusion, I find that the evidence is insufficient to satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the SO, or any other police officer involved in the arrest of the Complainant, resorted to an excessive use of force in these circumstances and I therefore lack the grounds to lay criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-324
2017,Cobourg Police Service,Head,Ontario, The cause of death for CW\xa0#12 was determined to be as a result of a single penetrating gunshot wound perforating the brain,criminal law and instead find there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.,https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ofd-313
2018,Ontario Provincial Police,Bruce,Ontario,As a result of the collision the Complainant sustained serious injuries,"In sum, while it is clear that the SO’s left turn created a risk of danger which had very significant consequencesfootnote 8[8], there is simply insufficient evidence that the SO’s driving meets the high threshold required to find a marked departure from the standard of care. I am therefore unable to form grounds to believe the SO committed a criminal offence in relation to the collision and the file will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-18-pvi-175
2017,York Regional Police,Dufferin,Ontario,The cause of death as determined by the Pathologist at the post-mortem examination was indicated as “perforating gunshot wounds of head,"I find, therefore, on this record, that the lethal force which took the life of the Complainant was justified pursuant to s. 25(1) and (3) of the Criminal Code and that the four subject officers, in acting to preserve the lives of the many, at the cost of the life of the Complainant, used no more force than was necessary to affect this lawful purpose. As such, I lack the reasonable grounds to believe that the actions exercised by any of the four subject officers fell outside the limits prescribed by the criminal law and instead find there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and none will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ofd-363
2017,Niagara Regional Police Service,James,Ontario, the Complainant went to the hospital where he was diagnosed with having suffered a “comminuted blowout fracture of the roof of the right bony orbit right eye-socket with a trapdoor configuration,"In conclusion, I find on the reliable evidence before me that there is no evidence that any excessive use of force was resorted to by any police officer in apprehending and arresting the Complainant, and that the force used was both reasonable and proportionate given the Complainant’s aggressive resistance to the arrest. As such, I find that these facts do not leave me with reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence occurred here and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-296
2017,Waterloo Regional Police Service,,Ontario,The cause of death for both Complainants was determined to be “multiple blunt force injuries due to or as the consequence of motor vehicle collision”,"As I find that there is no basis to hold either of the two subject officers responsible for the catastrophic outcome of the motor vehicle collision, I further find that there is insufficient evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed. Accordingly, no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovd-287
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,The Complainant was assessed and diagnosed with having sustained several lacerations to his face as well as a displaced right nasal bone fracture,"sustained, I find that there are no reasonable grounds upon which to lay criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-323
2017,York Regional Police,St. Catharines,Ontario, The examination revealed the Complainant had also sustained a non-displaced fracture to his left zygoma cheekbone and a comminuted fracture of his left mandibular angle/ramus jawbone,"I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and that there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-282
2017,North Bay Police Service,North Bay,Ontario, X-rays were also taken of the thoracic spine lumbar spine and cervical spine with no abnormalities lesions fractures or soft tissue swelling noted,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention, and the manner in which it was carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injury which she may have suffered, even were I to find that the officers caused an injury, which I am not inclined to do. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-280
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,The Complainant was reportedly diagnosed with a ruptured left eardrum which did not require any treatment,"In sum, although significant force was used against the Complainant during his arrest, the force in these circumstances was lawful pursuant to s. 25(1) of the Criminal Code. Therefore, I have no reasonable grounds to believe that SO #1 or SO #2, or any other TPS officer, committed a criminal offence in relation to the allegation and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-271
2018,Hamilton Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario,"He would go on to die in hospital on April\xa021,\xa02018 of a brain injury induced by head trauma","There are no reasonable grounds in my view to believe that the SO committed a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s fall and subsequent death. I am satisfied on the record that the officers, including the SO, acted reasonably in their attempts to bring the situation involving the Complainant to a safe resolution. Their efforts at communicating with the Complainant throughout the engagement, though falling on deaf ears, were at all times professional and clearly aimed at de-escalation. While focusing on the Complainant, the SO and the other officers also had their minds set on the safety of the public around them. They cordoned off an area around the homes to ensure emergency responders had unimpeded access to the scene, warned the Complainant to steer clear of electrical wires overhead, directed onlookers to return to their homes so as not to further agitate the Complainant, and called for the added expertise of police negotiators. Regrettably, the plan put in place for the negotiators was frustrated when they were unable to establish a clear line of communication with the Complainant from the second floor of residence #3 shortly before he fell to the ground. In these circumstances, it is apparent that the SO exercised a level of care throughout the hour or so he was on scene that fell well within the limits prescribed by the criminal law, notwithstanding the Complainant’s fall and eventual death. Consequently, this file is closed as there are no reasonable grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-18-ocd-099
2017,Greater Sudbury Police Service,Greater Sudbury,Ontario,The Complainant was diagnosed with a three-part fracture of the right clavicle collarbone for which he was placed in a shoulder immobilizing sling,"In conclusion, on this record, I find that the evidence does not provide me with the necessary grounds for the laying of criminal charges, and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-335
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Clarington,Ontario, the Complainant was taken to LHC by ambulance and diagnosed with a fracture in his right wrist,"In sum, I am reluctant to attribute the Complainant’s injury to the SO’s actions. Assuming the SO caused the injury, there is insufficient evidence that the SO used excessive force or was negligent in his use of handcuffs. Accordingly, I have no reasonable grounds to believe that the SO committed any criminal offence in connection the injury and the case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-315
2017,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario, Neither injury required any medical intervention,"In conclusion, on this evidentiary record, I find that I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer present during the incident resorted to an excessive use of force in attempting to restrain the Complainant, nor that any police officer was responsible for the injuries sustained by the Complainant. Consequently, there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-270
2017,Hamilton Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario,The post-mortem examination was performed on October 14 2017,"In the final analysis, given the mitigating circumstances associated with the SO’s singular indiscretion, if it be such, and weighed against the professionalism with which the officer otherwise approached his task, I am satisfied on balance that the SO exercised a level of care in his dealings with the Complainant that fell well within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. Consequently, there are no reasonable grounds to believe the SO committed a criminal offence in connection with the Complainant’s tragic death and this file is closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-297
2017,Hamilton Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario, The Complainant was eventually seen at hospital and diagnosed with a meniscus tear to the right knee,"In sum, I do not believe that the SO exceeded the level of force permitted by law and therefore am unable to form grounds to believe he committed an offence. This file is therefore closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-318
2017,,Ajax,Ontario,The Complainant did not completely recover from her injury and has been in and out of hospital and is now convalescing at a nursing home,"On balance, I am satisfied on this record that the SO comported himself within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law. While the officer’s speed may legitimately attract scrutiny, it was not such as to render his driving in and around the time of the collision a marked departure from the standard a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances. For these reasons, there are no reasonable grounds in my view for proceeding with charges in this case, and the file is closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-293
2018,Toronto Police Service,Simcoe,Ontario,He was diagnosed with a non-displaced fracture to his right scaphoid the largest carpal bone of the wrist located on the thumb side of the hand,"That, however, does not end the matter. The question remains whether the actions of the SO rose to the level required to make out the offence of criminal negligence causing bodily harm, contrary to s. 221 of the Criminal Code. As an offence of penal negligence, it is predicated in part on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances. There are, in my view, reasonable grounds to believe that the SO, immediately prior to the collision between his car door and the bicycle and person of the Complainant, did not take the necessary precautions when he opened his door into bicycle traffic and thereby caused the injuries to the Complainant. Had the officer done so, I am satisfied that he would have seen the Complainant and waited for the cyclist to clear before opening his car door. On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that the SO was in fact mindful of cyclists in the bicycle lane in the seconds preceding the collision with the Complainant and his bicycle. From the moment the officer pulled up in his cruiser behind CW #4’s vehicle, he had seen and allowed two cyclists to pass him before nudging his driver’s side door slightly ajar while waiting for a third cyclist to go by. In the final analysis, while the SO was clearly to blame for causing the accident and may well be liable for committing an offence under s. 165 of the HTA, his indiscretion amounted in essence to a momentary lack of attention and fell short of constituting a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances. Consequently, I am satisfied that there is no basis for proceeding with criminal charges against the subject officer in this case, and the file is closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-18-tvi-170
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Belleville,Ontario,While both occupants of the civilian vehicle and all three occupants of the police vehicle were injured to varying degrees the following persons suffered “serious injuries” for purposes of the SIU’s jurisdiction Complainant 1 multiple fractures of his left leg Complainant 2 fractures to her spine and left foot and WO 1 concussion and soft tissue damage to left leg,"That said, I am satisfied that the SO’s indiscretion as regards his speed is not such as to render his conduct a marked departure from a reasonable level of care. To reiterate, but for the SO’s speed in and around the scene of the accident, there is nothing to suggest that his driving was anything other than safe and reasonable. And though the roads were wet on the night of the incident, it also bears noting that they were in good repair, visibility was decent given the artificial lighting in the area and vehicular traffic was light, factors which in my view temper if not excuse the SO’s speed. In the final analysis, while the officer’s driving was not perfect, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that it fell well within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law and that there is therefore no basis for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pvi-331
2017,Windsor Police Service,Windsor,Ontario,The Complainant’s right hand was put in a cast and he was given a follow up appointment with the fracture clinic,"As such, although I find that the Complainant’s injury was likely caused by the police officers going to the ground with him, and the Complainant landing on his outstretched hand, I find that pursuant to section 25(1) of the Criminal Code, the officers involved used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the execution of their lawful duties, and I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that their actions fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are thus no grounds to believe they committed a criminal offence and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-279
2017,Niagara Regional Police Service,,Ontario,He was prescribed pain killers for the rib injuries and is expected to fully recover,"In reviewing the evidence in its entirety, I accept that the SO responded to the situation in full compliance with the Ontario Police Services Act provisions regarding suspect apprehension pursuits and that he behaved at all times professionally, prudently, and with good common sense. As such, I find that there is absolutely no basis here for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-246
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,The Complainant sustained an un-displaced nasal fracture which was expected to heal on its own without the requirement of medical intervention,"In conclusion, on the reliable evidence before me, I can only say with certainty that at some point the Complainant was injured, but I am unable to find that there is sufficient evidence to establish exactly how, when, or by whom, the Complainant was injured, and I therefore do not have sufficient reliable evidence upon which I can find, on reasonable grounds, that an offence of assault bodily harm has been committed by any police officer involved in the apprehension and arrest of the Complainant and therefore do not have the grounds necessary for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-TCI-156
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Renfrew,Ontario, Complainant\xa0#2 sustained a nasal fracture and a small pneumothorax collapsed lung on his left and right sides,Original signed by,https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pvd-276
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,The Complainant sustained a comminuted fracture of the coronoid process of the right elbow,"On these facts, I cannot find that the SO resorted to an excessive use of force nor that I have reasonable grounds to believe that his actions amounted to a criminal offence and no charges shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-264
2017,Belleville Police Service,Belleville,Ontario,The Complainant took responsibility for the collision and was taken to a hospital where it is alleged that he was diagnosed with fractures to his pelvis and right knee,"The only charge to be considered in these circumstances would be one of criminal negligence causing bodily harm contrary to s. 221 of the Criminal Code. A person is criminally negligent when he or she shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives and safety of other persons in doing something or omitting to do anything he or she has a duty to do. The Court of Appeal for Ontario further clarified in R. v. Sharp (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 428 (Ont. C.A.) that criminal negligence requires a marked and substantial departure from the standard of care of a reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused. In this case, there is no evidence that the SO’s decision to call out to the Complainant amounted to a “marked and substantial” departure from the standard of a reasonable police officer. Police officers are required to execute arrest warrants and I can find no fault with the SO for calling out to the Complainant in an attempt to execute the arrest. When the SO called out to the Complainant he was in a parking lot by a pedestrian bridge on the east side of the river and it was in no way foreseeable that the Complainant would be hit by a pickup truck when he rode away from the SO. Furthermore, as the Complainant was already biking and simply decided not to stop for the police, who did not pursue him, I cannot find that there is any causal connection between the actions of the SO and the Complainant’s injuries. For these reasons, I find there are no reasonable grounds to believe the SO committed a criminal offence relating to this incident and the case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-283
2017,Toronto Police Service,Laird,Ontario,The Complainant was admitted to hospital where she remained for some time Due to her refusal to consent to the release of her medical records or to speak with investigators the nature of her injures or subsequent treatment could not be determined,"In conclusion, there is no basis upon which I can find reasonable grounds to believe that the SO, or any police officer involved in the attempted vehicle stop of the Equinox SUV, drove in a dangerous manner and there is no evidence to support a causal connection between the injury sustained by the front passenger of the Equinox and the actions of police. Consequently, there is no evidence upon which I am able to find that any criminal offence was committed by any police officer in these circumstances, and no charges shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tvi-269
2017,Greater Sudbury Police Service,,Ontario,His left shoulder was placed in a sling and his injury was expected to heal naturally,"On the record before me, I can find no evidence that the actions of any of the three responding police officers amounted to an excessive use of force or that there is any evidence upon which I could be satisfied that their actions fell outside of the limits of the criminal law and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-268
2017,Guelph Police Service,Guelph,Ontario,A CT scan of the Complainant’s head and facial bones was carried out and he was diagnosed with a comminuted and mildly displaced nasal bone fracture,"which he sustained. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and that there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-259
2017,Halton Regional Police Service,Burlington,Ontario,The Complainant was diagnosed with having sustained an avulsion fracture the detachment of a bone fragment that results from the pulling away of a ligament tendon or joint capsule of her left shoulder,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention, and the manner in which it was carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injury which she sustained. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-260
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,On September 14 2017 at approximately 8:30 a.m CW 8 walked his young grandchildren to school in the City of Toronto While CW 8 was walking home from the school he was in the company of his neighbour CW 6 As CW 8 and CW 6 walked north on Driftwood Avenue towards their townhome complexes the Complainant was walking south on Driftwood Avenue towards them Just as the Complainant passed CW 8 the Complainant attacked him with a knife The Complainant stabbed and punched CW 8 several times in the face and head area Many civilian witnesses yelled at and told the Complainant to stop however the Complainant continued to repeatedly stab and punch CW 8 A few minutes later the SO and WO\xa0#1 arrived and they repeatedly told the Complainant to stop and to drop the knife The SO discharged his firearm once striking the Complainant in the abdomen area CW\xa0#8 the Complainant and the SO were transported to various hospitals in the city,"As such, I am not only satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and that there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case, but it is my view that there was no other option available to the SO than to discharge his firearm, and that his actions in all likelihood saved CW #8 from even more serious injuries, if not death.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tfi-258
2017,Greater Sudbury Police Service,Greater Sudbury,Ontario,Following the post-mortem the attending pathologist determined that the cause of death of the Complainant was from a single contact gunshot wound to his right temple which perforated his head and brain,"As such, the police officers, who responded to this crisis as quickly as they were able, cannot be held responsible for the Complainant’s actions in fulfilling his intention to end his own life. On these facts, there are no reasonable grounds here for the laying of criminal charges and none will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-242
2017,Ottawa Police Service,Head,Ontario,Complainant\xa0#2’s ear injury was not considered serious and was treated by the paramedics at the scene,"In sum, I am satisfied that the discharge of the subject officers’ firearms at Complainant #1 was justified under both ss. 25 and 34 of the Criminal Code. Accordingly, I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that SO #1 or SO #2 committed a criminal offence in connection with the complainants’ injuries and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ofi-255
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,,Ontario, It is alleged that the CW shortly after the pursuit was terminated rear-ended the Complainant’s vehicle causing him a serious injury,"As there is no evidence that the SO’s driving was objectively dangerous, amounted to a marked departure from the standard of a reasonable police officer, or contributed to the Complainant’s injuries, I am satisfied that there are no reasonable grounds to believe the SO committed an offence. No charges will issue and the case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pvi-254
2017,Peel Regional Police,,Ontario, It is alleged that the Complainant received injuries to his kidneys shoulders and right wrist during his apprehension,"In conclusion, I have no reasonable grounds to believe the subject officer or any PRP officer committed a criminal offence with respect to the Complainant’s apprehension. While there is some evidence that the Complainant’s wrist was injured when he was apprehended, the PRP officers did not use unreasonable force, applied the handcuffs in the lawful execution of their duties, and were not negligent in doing so. As such, no charges will issue and this case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-253
2017,Windsor Police Service,Amherstburg,Ontario,The post-mortem examination confirmed that he died of an intraoral gunshot wound to the head,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied there is no evidence to indicate that the witness officers bore any criminal responsibility for the Complainant’s decision to end his life. Nothing from the investigation suggested that the involved officers were anything less than professional and cautious in what was inherently a tense situation. Accordingly, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-262
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Rideau Lakes,Ontario,The Complainant was examined and found to have sustained a fracture to the right inferior pubic bone and a medial fracture to the left ankle,"As such, I find that there is no evidence upon which I can form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed by any of the police officers in their efforts to stop the Complainant, and therefore there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pvi-232
2017,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario," At the post-mortem examination of the Complainant’s body conducted at the CFS by the CFS forensic pathologist on August\xa028,\xa02017 the provisional cause of death was found to be “gunshot wound of abdomen","I find, therefore, on this record, that the shot that was fired and which struck and killed the Complainant was justified pursuant to s. 25(1) and (3) of the Criminal Code and that the SO, in preserving himself, or others, from threat of the infliction of grievous bodily harm or death at the hands of the Complainant, used no more force than was necessary to affect his lawful purpose. As such, I lack the reasonable grounds to believe that the actions exercised by the SO fell outside the limits prescribed by the criminal law and instead find that there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ofd-193
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Brant,Ontario, No other injuries were noted,"On all of the evidence, I find I have reasonable grounds to believe the Complainant’s original statement that he was treated well by police and that all of his injuries were self-inflicted and as a direct consequence of his jumping from the roof of the Tim Hortons building and landing on both heels and his outstretched left wrist, some 30 feet below, on concrete. I have no basis upon which I can form reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer used any force, much less any excessive force, against the Complainant and as such there is no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-230
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,The Complainant’s medical records revealed that the Complainant had sustained a mildly displaced fracture of the lateral ninth right rib,"On this evidence, there is absolutely no basis upon which I can form reasonable grounds to believe that the Complainant was in any way mistreated by police, and there is no basis for believing that he sustained his injuries at the hands of police. As such, there is no basis for the laying of any criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-277
2017,Woodstock Police Service,Elgin,Ontario,Although the level of clonazepam was within the therapeutic range the findings at the scene suggested that clonazepam could also have contributed to the cause of death,"In conclusion, it is clear on all of the evidence that there was no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the SO in notifying the Complainant of his pending charges and, on this record, the evidence does not satisfy me on reasonable grounds that any criminal offence was committed and thus no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ood-208
2017,,Espanola,Ontario,The Complainant attended hospital and was diagnosed with having sustained a mildly comminuted fracture involving the surgical neck joint of the right humerus the bone in the upper arm which was predominantly non-displaced,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he sustained. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-257
2017,,Head,Ontario,He was taken to SJHC where it is alleged that he was diagnosed with a fractured cheekbone and nose,"Before closing the file, I note that the comments made by WO #4 on the ICCS after the incident were unprofessional. WO #4 joked that the officers “tuned” the Complainant and that there were “fists flying”; however, I am satisfied these comments were made by WO #4 as an attempt to cope with a stressful situation and do not accord with what actually occurred (or what was observed and reported even by the complainant) and as such, in all the circumstances, for the foregoing reasons I have no reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence occurred and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-198
2017,Sault Ste. Marie Police Service,Sault Ste. Marie,Ontario, Recommended treatment was a soft diet for three weeks and if the fracture did not resolve itself then jaw fixation for four to six weeks would be required,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the arrest of the Complainant, and the manner in which it was carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am, therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds that the actions of the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. Accordingly, with respect to the subject officer, I can find no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-107
2017,,Durham,Ontario,He also had an un-displaced subtle fracture in the distal 3rd nasal bone and a possible more subtle fracture of the nasal spine,"The aggravating factor of operating a motor vehicle with an excess of alcohol that registered twice the legal limit at which one can legally operate a motor vehicle resulted not only in a potentially fatal motor vehicle collision, but appears to have contributed to the Complainant’s persisting resistance, aggressiveness, and use of obscenities directed at the DRPS and OPP officers. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds that the actions of the SO, and all the other police officers involved in the Complainant’s apprehension and arrest, fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. Accordingly, I can find no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case and none will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-148
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,Following the taking of x-rays it was determined that the Complainant had a non-displaced fracture of the posterior 12th rib as well as the posterolateral in back and away from the midline 10th rib on the left side and a possible fracture of the posterolateral 11th rib on the left side and a small left-sided pneumothorax collapsed lung,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the pursuit and apprehension of the Complainant, and the manner in which they were carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injuries which he suffered. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-177
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Northumberland,Ontario,It was also found that the Complainant’s bones were osteopenic meaning that her Bone Mineral Density BMD was below normal levels with a greater chance of developing osteoporosis a condition where bones are weak and fractures can occur,I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by both police officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and that there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.,https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-249
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Caledon,Ontario,The Complainant was diagnosed with a fracture to his left ninth rib and a fracture to his sternum,"On this record, I find that the evidence of the SO’s driving does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute ‘a marked departure from the norm’ and, as indicated earlier, there is no evidence of a causal connection between the actions of the SO and the motor vehicle collision in which the Complainant was injured. In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code, the Highway Traffic Act and the Ontario Police Services Act, but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently and with good common sense. In conclusion, I find that the evidence before me does not satisfy me that I have reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed here by the SO and, as such, I find that there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pvi-207
2017,Peel Regional Police,Toronto,Ontario,He was diagnosed with a fracture of the 10th rib on his right side which was minimally displaced,"In the alternative, were I to reject the evidence of the three police officers involved in favour of the evidence of the Complainant, the evidence would be lacking in that it failed to identify who the officer was who actually assaulted the Complainant as alleged, and I would still lack the grounds necessary to believe that any one of these three police officers committed the alleged excessive use of force as against the Complainant and would still be without the grounds necessary to lay charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-144
2017,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Kitchener,Ontario,A CT scan was performed on the Complainant’s head revealing a subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral contusions,"On this record, not only is there no evidence to satisfy me that any police officer involved with the Complainant committed any criminal offence, but I find that on all of the evidence both WO #1 and the SO provided the Complainant with the best of care available to them, when all other resources proved to be unavailable. As such, I find that there is no basis here for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-225
2017,Sarnia Police Service,Head,Ontario,As a result of the swelling to her nasal area a CT scan was then performed which revealed “a largely non-displaced subtle fracture of the right nasal bone” with no specific treatment required,"In conclusion, I accept that the SO was justified in resorting to the amount of force which he did in order to repel the attack by the Complainant and find that the evidence does not satisfy me that I have reasonable grounds to believe a criminal offence was perpetrated by the SO and therefore no charges shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-231
2017,,Head,Ontario,The immediate cause of death was determined to be a “gunshot wound of the head”,"It is notable that at no time were any allegations made against these officers by anyone with respect to any inappropriate actions on their part, and I am satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-190
,,Petrolia,Ontario,His injuries included bruising under both eyes bruising on his left shoulder bruising on the left side of his forehead and bruising to both elbows and on his upper left leg,,https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-215
2017,Windsor Police Service,Windsor,Ontario,An X-ray was ordered and it was discovered that there was a displaced nasal bone fracture,"In conclusion, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the arrest of the Complainant, and the manner in which it was carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injury which the Complainant suffered. The injuries sustained by the Complainant occurred as a direct result of his own non-compliance with the commands of the SO – who was acting under the authority of CW #2 - and the active struggle to resist arrest including the dangerous act by CW #3 of attempting to grab WO #1’s CEW (or at the very least attempting to knock the CEW out of his hand). In this respect, both the Complainant and CW #3 were the authors of their own misfortune, which resulted from the Complainant’s refusal to leave the school when legally and properly directed to do so. I am, therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds that the actions of the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. Accordingly, with respect to the SO, I can find no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-138
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,The Complainant sustained a punctured lung and two associated fractured ribs on his right side,"If, however, the SO did cause the injury, I find that his single punch, which was delivered in response to an aggressive act by the Complainant toward the SO, did not amount to an excessive use of force and does not provide me with reasonable grounds to believe that the SO’s action rose to the level of a criminal act and no charges will therefore issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-200
2017,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,The Complainant was assessed and diagnosed with a laceration to the right eyebrow a fractured nose and a brain bleed,"Furthermore, it is clear from the video that the actions of the SO were measured and in direct proportion to the Complainant’s resistance. The fact that the Complainant, when he suddenly stopped resisting, was flung forward with great momentum, is simply the result of the laws of physics and I do not attribute any intent on the part of the SO to injure the Complainant, which was simply an unfortunate consequence of the combined actions of the SO and the Complainant.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-204
2017,Thunder Bay Police Service,Thunder Bay,Ontario,The report indicated that given the history autopsy findings and ancillary tests the death of the Complainant was attributed to hypertensive heart disease,"On all of the evidence, it appears that the tragic death of the Complainant was as a result of his lifestyle and possibly other genetic or medical factors which were unknown to police and paramedics and there is no causal connection between the actions or inaction of any police officer or the SO and the death of the Complainant. On this record, I can find no basis for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-182
2017,,Head,Ontario,The next day the Complainant fainted and attended the hospital for a second time where he was diagnosed with having a mild concussion,"Based on the record, I am unable to form reasonable grounds for a finding of excessive force by the SO. The evidence provides uncertainty as to the timing and mechanism of the injury to the Complainant’s forehead and his concussion. Additionally, the weaknesses in the Complainant’s recollection and the SO and WO #2’s denial of the assault leave me with uncertainty about what actually transpired. I am therefore unable to conclude that the SO bears any criminal liability for her actions during her encounter with the Complainant. As such, no charges will be laid and this case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-127
2017,,Head,Ontario," On July\xa04th,\xa02017 the Complainant was seen by his own doctor and was assessed with the doctor noting that the Complainant had an abrasion to the occiput back part of the head an ongoing headache and photophobia sensitivity to light from which he determined that the Complainant had sustained a mild concussion","As such, in the final analysis, given that the nature of the fall and striking of the head against the ground was unintentional, no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-178
2017,Hamilton Police Service,Strong,Ontario,"On March\xa03,\xa02016 it was confirmed that the Complainant had a left rib fracture","In conclusion, I am not satisfied on this record that the force used to arrest the Complainant fell outside the prescribed limits of the criminal law. Accordingly, I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe that SO #1, SO #2 and SO #3 committed a criminal offence in relation to their interactions with the Complainant on February 17, 2016. As a result, no charges will issue and this case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-051
2017,Niagara Regional Police Service,,Ontario,The medial wall of the left orbit was also fractured,"In conclusion, having reviewed all of the evidence and the jurisprudence in this area, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful, notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-128
2017,South Simcoe Police Service,Head,Ontario,X-rays of the Complainant’s right foot revealed un-displaced fractures of the proximal metaphyses of the second third and fourth metatarsals,"On these facts, I find that I lack the reasonable grounds to believe that either officer resorted to an excessive use of force in apprehending and subduing the Complainant or that either officer committed a criminal offence here and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-161
2017,Peel Regional Police,,Ontario,It was believed that the congenital defect in the Complainant’s left arm bone most likely pre-disposed him to sustain the type of fracture he did as this would not have occurred if he had normal bone structure,"On all of the evidence, I accept that the two police officers present were carrying out their duties in assisting medical and security staff to ensure the safety of the Complainant and those around him, and that the injury sustained by him can only be described as an unforeseeable and unexpected anomaly.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-221
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,The Complainant suffered a fractured pelvis chipped teeth and abrasions,"In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code, the HTA, the TPS Suspect Apprehension Pursuit policy and the OPSA, but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently and with good common sense. I cannot find any criticism of the SO’s actions and, as such, find that there is absolutely no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tvi-288
2017,Windsor Police Service,Windsor,Ontario,The Complainant was treated for three lacerations to the left side of his neck and two lacerations to the right side of his neck,"Had the Complainant simply come forward and given himself up, there would have been no need to deploy the PSD. I can only infer from the Complainant’s comments that he was aware that he was wanted by police that he hid from police for that reason. The Complainant rolled the dice and lost. These were decisions made by him and him alone, with the full knowledge and numerous warnings that the dog would be dispatched if the Complainant did not comply. On the evidence before me, I find that I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that the SO resorted to an excessive use of force in deploying his PSD and therefore do not have reasonable grounds to believe that he committed any criminal offence and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-140
2017,,Brampton,Ontario,Otherwise no fracture seen,"In conclusion, I find on the reliable evidence before me, that there is no evidence that any excessive use of force was resorted to by any police officer in apprehending and arresting the Complainant and that the force used was both reasonable and proportionate. As such, I find that these facts do not leave me with reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence occurred here and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-165
2017,,Chatham-Kent,Ontario,He was diagnosed with a comminuted fracture a break/splinter of the bone into more than two fragments of the nasal bone and nasal septum,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention, and the manner in which it was carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he sustained and am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case and none will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-168
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,He was transported to the hospital where he was diagnosed as having sustained a fractured right orbital bone a bone in the eye socket,"On these facts, I accept that police were involved in a fast moving situation where there was a potential threat up to, and until, all occupants of the apartment were subdued and I find that the single punch from the SO, which he used only after the Complainant had grabbed onto his leg and refused to release him, and while the Complainant was refusing to comply with police commands to get down onto the floorfootnote 2[2] and to put his hands behind his back, does not satisfy me on reasonable grounds that the officer acted outside of the limits of the criminal law, nor do I find that the evidence is such as to satisfy me on reasonable grounds that the SO committed a criminal offence and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-166
2017,Hamilton Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario,On the evening of August 4th 2017 a 911 call was received by the HPS at 11:14 p.m reporting that the caller CW 2 had been contacted by her mother who had indicated that her boyfriend the Complainant was becoming violent CW 2 and CW 1 then travelled to Hamilton to investigate the situation Once CW 2 arrived on scene she removed a dog from the Complainant’s care When she did so the Complainant threw a bag and a wine bottle at CW 2 Once the police arrived they determined that they had reasonable grounds to arrest the Complainant for assaulting CW\xa0#2 The Complainant was initially cooperative with the police officers but when the police officers started to handcuff and search him he became agitated and started to hit his head on the rear of the police cruiser and resisted being loaded into the police vehicle The Complainant was then transported to the police station where he was lodged in a cell at 1:14\xa0a.m At 2:46\xa0a.m the Complainant stood at the cell door and then collapsed onto the floor He was then transported to hospital,"In conclusion, on the basis of the reliable evidence on this record, I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer, in his or her interaction with the Complainant, ever resorted to an excessive use of force and there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges and none will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-203
2017,Hanover Police Service,Hanover,Ontario, As a result of the Complainant’s head impacting with the pavement the Complainant sustained a significant laceration and more significantly a severely fractured skull and near-fatal brain injuries,"As such, while I am hopeful that the concerns expressed will be adequately addressed within the HPS in order that an incident such as this will not recur, I am unable to find that I have reasonable grounds to cause a charge of dangerous driving to be laid in this instance, and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-062
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,"On Tuesday July\xa018th,\xa02017 the Complainant was diagnosed with a left fractured frontal sinus bone and required surgery to repair the fracture","In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I fully accept that the Complainant’s injuries primarily came about as a result of efforts by police to overcome his assaultive and resistant behaviour, and as soon as the Complainant ceased in these efforts, no further force was employed against him by any police officer. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-181
2017,London Police Service,London,Ontario,The Complainant suffered a scotoma which is a visual disturbance sometimes associated with a concussion The Complainant told the SIU that the effects of the scotoma are transient occurring most frequently when he moves between areas of differing light intensity The effects occur briefly and soon disappear,"Ultimately, while I find that the serious injury to the Complainant, if there was one, as the assessment was not entirely definitive, was caused by a blow by the SO to the Complainant’s head after the Complainant had assaulted the SO, and the Complainant was now in possession of a potential weapon with which he could inflict further injury against the police officers, I cannot find that the evidence is such as to satisfy me that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the SO’s actions were excessive and/or unjustified in these circumstances. I accept that the SO reacted quickly to what he perceived to be a dangerous situation and acted to bring the Complainant under control as quickly as possible and thereby ensure the safety of himself and his fellow officers. As such, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the actions resorted to by the SO, although not perfect, fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and that there are no grounds to believe that he committed a criminal offence and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-130
2017,York Regional Police,,Ontario,He was transported to a YRP division and then by ambulance to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a fracture of the nasal bone and a fracture of the nasal spine of the maxilla,"While an unsatisfactory result, I must find that on the five contradictory versions of the five only witnesses to the interaction between the Complainant and police, I am unable to find that any version is able to satisfy me on reasonable grounds as to what occurred here, the only fact not in issue being that the Complainant suffered fractures to his nasal bone and nasal spine. While there is no question that had the SO struck the Complainant in the face with the butt of his firearm, after the Complainant was already on the ground and handcuffed, or even before he was handcuffed, that act would normally amount to an excessive use of force and the basis for the laying of criminal charges; however, in the absence of some conclusive evidence, in either direction, I am unable make any findings of fact and find that the evidence is not sufficient to satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-173
2017,Kingston Police,Kingston,Ontario,He was treated at hospital for a deep wound at least five cm in diameter to the upper left arm,"On all of the evidence, I find that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the SO committed any criminal offence here and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-219
2017,South Simcoe Police Service,Innisfil,Ontario, Before being processed at the police station the male Complainant was treated at the hospital,"On all of the evidence, I find that both of the Complainants were very obstructive and confrontational, both with the police officers attempting to carry out their investigation and the CWs, and that the officers showed extreme patience throughout and only resorted to arresting and taking both the Complainants to the ground as a consequence to their ongoing obstruction and their increasingly assaultive behaviour. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-176
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Perth,Ontario,There may also have been a fracture of the inferior neck of the glenoid shoulder joint,"On a side note, I wish to acknowledge the level headed and professional behaviour of WO #2 who, despite having just witnessed the Complainant ram WO #1’s vehicle, and almost being run down by the Complainant, declined to engage the Complainant in a police pursuit, instead putting the safety of the public ahead of his desire to apprehend the Complainant. WO #2’s comments that since they had identified the Complainant as the driver they would be able to get him another day, was in full compliance with Ontario Regulation 266/10 of the Ontario Police Services Act entitled Suspect Apprehension Pursuits, and exhibited a calm, rational, and professional approach which was extremely admirable in the circumstances.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-092
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Head,Ontario,Surgery was required to mend the fractured hip,"In the final analysis, there is no evidence upon which I can reasonably find that any police officer resorted to an excessive use of force against the Complainant, nor even that any police officer made any physical contact at all with the Complainant, prior to his fall and subsequent injury, and that therefore there is no causal connection between the actions of the SO, WO #1, or WO #2, and the injury sustained by the Complainant. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-153
2017,,,Ontario,In the late evening on June 30th 2017 into the early morning hours of July 1st 2017 CW 1 received numerous text messages from her husband indicating that he intended to do harm to himself As a result CW 1 called the CKPS and officers were dispatched to the Complainant’s residence to do a well-being check Police arrived at the residence at 1:39\xa0a.m and observed the Complainant seated in his back yard with a gasoline container on his lap Police attempted to engage the Complainant from the other side of the fence surrounding his back yard as he would not give them permission to enter As the officers tried to speak to the Complainant to discern why the Complainant was upset and what they could do to help the Complainant counted to three doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire The police officers then immediately entered the yard and doused the flames,"On these facts, it is clear that there is no causation between the actions of police and the serious injuries to the Complainant nor is there any evidence upon which I can form any reasonable grounds to believe that any of the police officers who attended and attempted to dissuade the Complainant from taking his own life committed any criminal offence and therefore no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ooi-167
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Grey,Ontario,On June 10th 2017 the Complainant was apprehended under the Mental Health Act MHA by the West Grey Police Service WGPS and taken to hospital where he was held On June 12th 2017 the Complainant escaped from the hospital and the OPP was contacted to attempt to locate the Complainant and return him to hospital The OPP located the Complainant on an all-terrain vehicle ATV trail The Complainant resisted arrest and a Conducted Energy Weapon CEW was deployed causing him to fall to the ground The Complainant was then returned to hospital and subsequently transferred to a second hospital for treatment,"On these facts, then, I find that I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer exercised an excessive use of force in apprehending the Complainant, and I specifically find that I lack reasonable grounds to believe that the SO’s successful deployment of his CEW, which caused the Complainant to fall to the ground hard, and was the likely cause of his injury/injuries, amounted to an excessive use of force on these facts and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-149
2017,Waterloo Regional Police Service,,Ontario,The Complainant sustained a comminuted fracture of the base of the left second metatarsal,"In conclusion, I find that the available reliable evidence does not satisfy me on reasonable grounds that the SO drove dangerously, or that the actions of either of the SO or WO #1 amounted to an excessive use of force despite the injury sustained by the Complainant. As such, I find that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed and no basis for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-145
2017,Niagara Regional Police Service,Niagara,Ontario,Those records did confirm a nasal bone fracture which is the subject injury of this investigation,"In conclusion, I find that the Complainant, in opting to flee from police after having been placed into handcuffs behind his back, was to a large degree the author of his own misfortune resulting in the injury that he sustained, and that the SO had no other options available to him at the time and he used no more force than what was required to apprehend the Complainant. On these facts, I am unable to find any reasonable grounds to believe that the SO exercised an excessive use of force, despite the unfortunate injury suffered by the Complainant, and there is no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-222
2017,Cobourg Police Service,Cobourg,Ontario,The preliminary cause of death was determined to be an “intraoral occurring within the mouth shotgun wound to the head,"Having said that, I would like to take a moment to address the actions of WO #9 who, in my estimation, went above and beyond the call of duty to attempt to assist the Complainant in a patient, professional, and compassionate manner. His actions included spending a lengthy period of time conversing with the Complainant on May 22nd, followed by his immediate response to the Complainant’s second call for help on May 23rd and another lengthy conversation. He made offers of many different types of intervention to attempt to assist the Complainant including his subsequent decision to apprehend the Complainant under the Mental Health Act and to take her to hospital, where he remained with her until she was discharged, and then returning her to the station and offering her further assistance including putting her in touch with the police chaplain. Moreover, his getting up on his day off, after having worked a 15 hour shift, with the intent of rushing to the scene to assist the Complainant in her ultimate time of crisis, speaks of a dedication and compassion that is a tribute to the CPS and policing services everywhere. As such, I would like to take this opportunity to commend WO #9 for his actions, despite the tragic outcome, and acknowledge that his patience and unflagging willingness to assist the Complainant likely brought her great comfort in her final hours, as witnessed by the fact that she again sought him out just prior to taking her life.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-126
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,,Ontario,On the evening of Saturday November 11th 2017 the Complainant was at a residence in Strathroy The Complainant and six other individuals present were highly intoxicated The Complainant became injured when he either punched a window or was pushed into a window during an altercation and he sustained a serious laceration to his left hand As a result 911 was called by someone inside the residence At approximately 8:47\xa0p.m the SCPS received a medical assist call to the residence related to the Complainant WO\xa0#4 WO\xa0#6 and WO\xa0#5 were dispatched to the residence Upon arrival the officers were met with resistance from the Complainant who was refusing medical treatment from EMS who were on scene It became apparent that the Complainant was too intoxicated to care for himself and despite his objections he was carried out of the residence by the officers and placed on a stretcher The Complainant calmed down once outside the residence and was transported to hospital Once at the hospital the Complainant had sufficiently calmed down to allow the SCPS police officers to leave him in the emergency department to be dealt with by nursing staff Once at the SCPS station CW\xa0#2 was contacted and advised that the Complainant had been injured and taken to the hospital CW\xa0#2 along with CW\xa0#1 went to the hospital at approximately 11:00\xa0p.m where they picked up the Complainant after he had received stitches to his left hand and had been discharged Once in the company of his family the Complainant again became agitated CW\xa0#2 was driving northbound along Centre Roadfootnote 1[1 in Strathroy when she felt she could not control the Complainant and she pulled into the parking lot of the Strathroy OPP Detachment The Complainant went to the front door and began banging on the door while CW\xa0#2 and CW\xa0#1 remained at the vehicle and called 911 The OPP Detachment was closed but the SO was inside The SO heard the Complainant banging on the door and she went to investigate The SO answered the door and saw that the Complainant was bleeding and agitated and after a brief discussion the SO told him to wait at the door while she went inside the Detachment to retrieve her gloves The Complainant returned to CW\xa0#2’s vehicle and decided that he was not waiting and he walked across the parking lot and headed towards Centre Road where he disappeared out of view and into the darkness At approximately 11:25\xa0p.m CW\xa0#3 and CW\xa0#4 were driving northbound on Centre Road in the vicinity of the OPP Detachment there was no artificial lighting and it was dark The Complainant was most likely walking in the middle of Centre Road and CW\xa0#3 did not see him CW\xa0#3’s vehicle was traveling at highway speeds when he struck the Complainant CW\xa0#2 and CW\xa0#1 were still at their vehicle when they saw a vehicle pass by the OPP Detachment and then they heard a thud CW\xa0#3 was unsure what had happened but believed he had hit something so he pulled onto the right shoulder of Centre Road and stopped Shortly after the SO came out of the Detachment and was notified by CW\xa0#2 that the Complainant had walked onto the roadway and may have been struck by a vehicle The SO entered a cruiser and drove out of the parking lot and onto Centre Road where she saw the Complainant lying in the middle of the roadway The SO then blocked the roadway as best she could with her cruiser,"Accordingly, in order to correct and complete the record in respect of this matter, this addendum should be appended to the Director’s Report to the Attorney General dated March 21, 2018, previously submitted to your office.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pcd-333
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,He was not expected to receive any additional medical support for his injury,"As such, on all of the evidence, I can find no evidence to form the basis to find reasonable grounds to believe that the injury suffered by the Complainant was caused by police. If he was injured when he entered the police cruiser, the video confirms positively that the injury was caused by the Complainant himself, and he may simply not have realized that he had injured himself until he became less groggy and was more aware of what was going on. If he did not sustain his injury while entering the police cruiser, the only remaining alternative is that the injury was sustained prior to police arrival. In conclusion, I can find no basis here for the laying of criminal charges against any police officer and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-096
2017,Windsor Police Service,,Ontario,"The Complainant was taken to the hospital on February 5th 2017 Triage notes indicated that the PSD bit the Complainant on his upper left arm He had seven deep puncture wounds over the deltoid biceps and triceps He had superficial claw marks on the right side of his head just behind his ear He had multiple lacerations on his left humerus which was X-rayed and found to be normal His wounds were cleaned and packed and he was given a referral to a plastic surgeon All of his wounds were cleaned and medicated but left open due to the high risk of infection No wounds were stitched or stapled He was seen the next day February\xa06th,\xa02017 by a plastic surgeon She removed the packing and there was no sign of infection","In conclusion, on the evidence before me, I find that I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that the SO resorted to an excessive use of force in deploying his PSD in the circumstances, and therefore do not have reasonable grounds to believe that he committed any criminal offence and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-102
2017,London Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,He was diagnosed with having suffered a ‘subtle non-displaced comminuted fracture of the right anterior maxilla right upper jaw with a non-displaced fracture through the root of the right lateral incisor’ a tooth located away from the midline of the face and the canine teeth,"In conclusion, while it is without dispute that the SO caused the injury to the Complainant, either from the strike itself or his subsequent fall to the floor, I find that pursuant to section 25(1) of the Criminal Code, the SO used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the execution of his lawful duties in a fast-paced, chaotic, and potentially dangerous situation. As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and that there are no grounds to believe he committed a criminal offence and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-143
2016,London Police Service,Head,Ontario,He was declared dead at the scene,"The case law under this section does not set out with any particularity what would constitute mischief other than that it has to “obstruct, interrupt or interfere with the lawful use” of property. There is no doubt that the events that unfolded in Mr. Maloney’s residence on the morning of December 23rd obstructed, interrupted or interfered with the lawful use of his home. The events also caused actual danger to the lives of all of its occupants - CW #1, her children, Mr. Maloney, and the officers inside. I am, however, again faced with the issue of causation. Was it the conduct of the officers who planned the execution of, or actually executed, the search warrant, that caused that actual danger to CW #1 and her children? Or was it the decisions made by Mr. Maloney, and the weapons he utilized in those decisions, that caused the danger? In the execution of the search warrant, SO #2 and SO #3 went immediately to the rear bedroom where the children were located, and remained there until the incident ended. They made efforts to get shields to remove the children. Their presence, I believe, actually ensured the safety of the civilian occupants of that room. For the same reasons discussed above, I conclude it was Mr. Maloney’s behaviour that caused the actual danger to the occupants. It was his decision to shoot a crossbow at an armed officer, instead of complying with his demands; it was his decision to ignore officers’ requests to surrender; and, it was his decision to run down the hallway towards his children, screaming, while armed with a hatchet and knives. Accordingly, I must find again that it was the intervening acts of Mr. Maloney that lead to his death and I am unable to find the necessary causal connection between the actions of police and the death of Mr. Maloney. On this evidence, I find that I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that any of the officers involved in either the planning or the subsequent execution of the search warrant committed any criminal offence and no charges shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ofd-320
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Markstay-Warren,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital and diagnosed with back and neck fractures,"I further find that the collision was a direct result of the Complainant’s poor judgment and possibly his level of intoxication and that there is no causal connection between the actions of the SO and the subsequent collision. As such, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pvi-105
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,The medical record noted that the Complainant was diagnosed with a navicular fracture and a fracture of the first metatarsal of his right foot,"In conclusion, I find on all of the credible evidence that no force other than the minimal amount required to bring the Complainant down from the fence and to handcuff him was used by either SO #2 or SO #1, and that there are no reasonable grounds upon which to believe that either police officer employed an excessive use of force against the Complainant, nor that they were the cause of his injuries and, as such, there is no evidence upon which to base a reasonable belief that a criminal offence was committed here.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-133
2017,Ottawa Police Service,Ottawa,Ontario,Upon completion of the post-mortem examination the Pathologist indicated that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head,"I find, therefore, on this record, that the shots that were fired, one of which struck and killed the Complainant, were justified pursuant to s.25(1) and (3) of the Criminal Code and that the SO, in preserving himself from death or grievous bodily harm from the Complainant, used no more force than was necessary to affect his lawful purpose. As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ofd-135
2017,Waterloo Regional Police Service,,Ontario,The Complainant’s cause of death was determined to be acute cocaine toxicity,"In conclusion, on all of the evidence, there is no complaint regarding the actions of the SO and absolutely no evidence upon which I can find any reasonable grounds to believe that the SO did anything other than what was appropriate and pursuant to his duties. As such, there is no basis for the laying of criminal charges and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-122
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,He was later diagnosed with fractured wrists,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the disarming of the Complainant and his ultimate detention, and the manner in which they were carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injuries which he suffered. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-106
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Sioux Lookout,Ontario, Three days later the Complainant had her wrist examined and she was diagnosed with having sustained a distal radial fracture,"In the final analysis, in the absence of any concrete evidence, I am unable to determine when, by what mechanism, or at whose hands, if any, the Complainant sustained her injury and am thus unable to form reasonable grounds to believe that any officer who had contact with the Complainant on April 6th, 2017, was responsible for that injury. On the record before me, I am satisfied that the actions exercised by the three police officers who had direct contact with the Complainant fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-124
2017,Hamilton Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario, The Complainant was admitted to the hospital for a psychiatric assessment,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful and fully justified in the circumstances; that the actions of all of the officers who deployed their CEWSO were not only justified, but frankly admirable and extremely well considered and can likely be credited with saving the life of the Complainant either from being shot or from ending his own life by slashing his throat. The SO attended late to the interaction, he assessed the situation with fresh eyes, he considered his options and he did not panic, instead waiting until the Complainant was in the optimal position before deploying his CEW. I find it further notable that the actions of police were observed by a number of civilian witnesses, all of whom found them to be appropriate to the circumstances and not excessive. One witness, specifically, indicated he was surprised that WO #7 did not shoot the Complainant and was of the view that the Complainant was killing himself when he was slicing his neck. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that there is no causal connection between the injuries suffered by the Complainant and the actions of police and that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-060
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,North Perth,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital after his arrest and was later diagnosed with a posterior acetabular wall and column fracture a fracture of the hip socket within the pelvis which required surgery,"In the final analysis, despite the serious nature of the Complainant’s injury and the fact that it was undeniably caused during his interaction with police, I can find no evidence upon which to find reasonable grounds to believe that either officer resorted to an excessive use of force. On all of the evidence, it is clear that the Complainant would not have been injured had he chosen not to fight the police officers who were trying to arrest him and simply waited for his day in court, rather than struggling and resisting his arrest and causing the fall of all three of them to the ground, which led to his injury. On these facts, the evidence does not satisfy me that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence was perpetrated here by either police officer and no charges shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-171
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario, The Complainant was admitted to the hospital where she was diagnosed with second and third degree burns to 75 of her total body surface and placed on a ventilator,"In the final analysis, despite the tragic outcome for the Complainant, I am satisfied that the injuries were the result of her voluntarily and intentionally lowering herself into a tub of scalding water without any intervention by police, and that she was thereafter pinned down in the tub with the police shield in order to disarm her and without any knowledge that she had in fact submerged herself in boiling water. I also find that police, immediately upon discovering what the Complainant had done and as soon as she was disarmed, removed her from the tub in order to minimize her self-inflicted injuries. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-090
2017,Toronto Police Service,King,Ontario,He also sustained a fracture to the fifth digit of his right hand and lacerations to the tendons of the fourth and fifth digits of his right hand,"In sum, I find on this evidence that the driving of the SO, while involved in the pursuit and attempt to investigate the Ford, does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and even less so “a marked and substantial departure from the norm” and I am unable to establish that there was a causal connection between the actions of the pursuing officers and the motor vehicle collision that caused the Complainant’s injury. As such, I find that there is insufficient evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed and no basis for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tvi-104
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,WO\xa0#3 sustained a cut and pain to his left ear and small cuts to his hand while CW\xa0#1 sustained some bruising but no serious injuries,"Additionally, I have considered the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.), that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety. On this record, it is clear that the force used by the SO and the other officers involved in the arrest of the Complainant and CW #1 fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances and was directly proportionate to the resistance and force being used by the Complainant and CW #1 to avoid their arrest. On this record, I am unable to find that I have reasonable grounds to believe that any police officer involved in the apprehension and arrest of the Complainant and CW #1 used any more force than was necessary in the circumstances and I therefore do not find that I have the reasonable grounds required for the laying of criminal charges, and none shall issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-070
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Head,Ontario, The Complainant had visible injuries to his head and face and was transported by ambulance to the hospital,"In conclusion, although the utilization of a PSD is a use of force option, in this instance it appears that it was not purposefully used as such. I find that the SO did not engage the dog to attack the Complainant and that the dog simply responded to what it perceived as a dangerous situation. On this record, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the SO employed the PSD to track the Complainant and that when the dog, on his own initiative, probably because he was startled, latched onto the Complainant, the SO commanded him to release almost immediately. Furthermore, I find that the injury caused by the dog was not the result of criminal negligence on the part of the SO as the Complainant’s popping out of the undergrowth and the dog’s reaction were totally unforeseeable and that, once the dog engaged, the SO acted immediately to release the dog’s grip. In all, the evidence indicates that the service dog latched onto the Complainant’s head for approximately two seconds and did not bite again after the initial “grip and hold.” On that basis, I am unable to find the actions of the SO either constituted “a marked and substantial departure from the standard of a reasonable person in the circumstances” or that he showed “a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others”. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-084
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario, The Complainant was taken to the hospital where a CT scan was completed and it was determined that there were no fractures but the Complainant had sustained a soft tissue injury to his head,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he may have suffered, the evidence of which is inconclusive. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-117
2017,,Whitby,Ontario,The Complainant was diagnosed with acute fractures of the left distal clavicle seven rib fractures left splenic renal laceration hepatic laceration left pelvic sacral hematoma and retroperitoneal hemorrhage liver laceration kidney laceration left sacral fracture left acetabular fracture oval lesion to the left thyroid left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures small left hemopneumothorax and mild left lower lobe contusion in the chest,"On this record, I find that the evidence of the SO’s driving does not rise to the level required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and, as indicated earlier, there is no evidence to support a causal connection between the actions of the SO and the collision and consequent injuries to the Complainant. While it may be that the SO only abandoned his police pursuit because he was directed to do so by WO #4 and that he then completely lost sight of CW #4 when he accelerated away from him, CW #4 was only able to do so because the SO put public safety ahead of his desire to apprehend CW #4. In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code, the HTA and the OPSA, but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently and with good common sense. I cannot find any criticism of the SO’s actions and, as such, find that there is no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-076
2017,Waterloo Regional Police Service,,Ontario,He was declared dead at the scene,"It is clear, on a review of all of the evidence, that the Complainant, possibly due to his paranoid state, felt compelled to take his own life. We cannot know what the Complainant’s intentions were when he told CW #1 to run for her life and barricaded himself in his home, but the senior officers tasked with commanding a team of police officers to bring this incident to an end could not take a risk that the Complainant may have accessed his firearms and either wanted to engage police in a fire fight or end the lives of others when he ended his own. It is clear that the Complainant took his own life without any intervention by police. It would be speculative to assume, had police acted with less caution and more quickly, that his life could have been saved at the risk of the loss of other human life. In fact, it is unclear as to when exactly the Complainant took his own life, but the presence of lividity and rigor mortis certainly points to the possibility that the Complainant ended his life either before the police had ever even come on the scene, or shortly thereafter. The SO, who was tasked with this incident, followed all procedures as set out in the WRPS Crisis Negotiation, Emergency Response and Hostage Rescue and Major Incident Command policy guidelines and attempted to apprehend the Complainant under the MHA with the least amount of force necessary while simultaneously ensuring the safety of all involved. In all, 27 police officers were deployed to attempt to safely apprehend the Complainant. Despite the tragic loss of life, no police officer at any point was ever successful in either making verbal or physical contact with the Complainant and they cannot be held responsible for his actions in fulfilling his intention to end his own life. As such, there are no reasonable grounds here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-068
2017,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,He was diagnosed with a fracture to his left inferior orbital wall and a fracture to his left maxillary sinus wall,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention, and the manner in which it was carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-064
2017,Toronto Police Service,Oshawa,Ontario, The Complainant was transported to a TPS division and then to the hospital where it was determined he suffered four facial fractures on the right side of his face,"In the final analysis, on all of the evidence, while I accept that the Complainant most likely injured his face when he forcefully struck the steering wheel in his car, it is also possible that he was injured when he was forcefully taken to the ground while trying to escape and was dragging SO #1 with his car. In either scenario, however, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention, and the manner in which it was carried out, were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered, even were I to find that the officers caused the injury, which I am hesitant to do on this evidence. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-097
2017,Toronto Police Service,Kingston,Ontario, An ambulance was called and the Complainant was transported to the hospital where it was determined that he had sustained a fractured left femur,"I find on this evidence that the driving of the SO, though certainly not advisable, does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and even less so “a marked and substantial departure from the norm” and I am unable to establish that there was a causal connection between the actions of the SO and the motor vehicle collision that caused the Complainant’s injuries. As such, I find that there is insufficient evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed and no basis for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tvi-059
2017,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Ottawa,Ontario,There were also fractures of the L4 and L5 vertebrae,"On the evidence before me, I find that the SO was dealing with a very angry, combative, irrational and intoxicated male who had already tried to physically pull the SO out of his cruiser, had disarmed him of his less lethal use of force option, pointed it at him, and had forced him to take cover behind his cruiser. On this record, I find that the SO’s resort to the use of his firearm was justified in these circumstances and that I have no reasonable grounds to believe that the SO committed any criminal offence and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ofi-042
2017,London Police Service,London,Ontario,CW\xa0#3 suffered only superficial injuries,"In the Director’s report dated January 16, 2018, reference is made to SO #1 driving over the spike belt. In, fact, she only drove over the rope from the spike belt, the belt itself not having been fully deployed, as is indicated in the report. Furthermore, while she immediately thereafter pulled over to the side of the road, there is no evidence that she did so because she drove over the rope of the spike belt.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-111
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,He fell twelve stories and was declared dead at the scene,"In the final analysis, I find no grounds, reasonable or otherwise, upon which to find any bases for any criminal conduct by any of the three police officers who attended at the apartment to try to save the life of the Complainant. Despite the tragic loss of life, the officers tasked with this incident followed all procedures as set out in their policy guidelines and cannot be held responsible for the Complainant’s actions in fulfilling his intention to end his own life. As such, there are no reasonable grounds here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tcd-046
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario, The Complainant was taken to a TPS division and later transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a fractured nose,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s injuries were unintentional and not as a result of an excessive use of force by either WO #2 or the SO, but the result of an unfortunate accident occurring during an unpredictable and difficult situation. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-038
2017,London Police Service,,Ontario,"During the early evening of October 8 2016 the Complainant had parked his boat in the driveway of the vacant residence that he owned with CW 1 thereby preventing any access to the front door When CW 1 and CW 2 attended and attempted to enter the home they were prevented from doing so because of the boat The Complainant who was across the street in his truck at the time called 911 as he believed CW\xa0#1 would damage the boat CW\xa0#1 also called 911 SO\xa0#1 and SO\xa0#2 responded to the call When SO\xa0#1 and SO\xa0#2 arrived they spoke to both the Complainant and CW\xa0#1 The officers advised the two men that because they both owned the home there was nothing they could do about the boat blocking access into the home The Complainant was belligerent towards SO\xa0#1 and SO\xa0#2 and went to his truck and consumed two vodka coolers SO\xa0#2 warned the Complainant about drinking alcohol and driving a vehicle The Complainant continued to yell at SO\xa0#1 and SO\xa0#2 While CW\xa0#1 attempted to move the boat in the presence of the officers the Complainant became upset and drove his truck quickly towards the hitch of the trailer nearly hitting CW\xa0#1 SO\xa0#1 and SO\xa0#2 approached the driver’s side of the Complainant’s truck and demanded that he get out The Complainant refused to exit the truck The officers pulled the Complainant out and grounded him The Complainant’s hands were handcuffed behind his back and he was placed inside of SO\xa0#1’s cruiser and taken to the police station While the Complainant was in a cell at the station he complained of back pain and was taken to the hospital An x-ray of the Complainant’s chest was taken and he was medically cleared and discharged and released from police custody A short time later another doctor from the hospital called the Complainant and told him that his chest x-ray report was misread and that he had a collapsed left lung On October\xa012,\xa02016 the Complainant went to the police station and filed an OIPRD complaint","In the final analysis, I conclude based on this record that there is no evidentiary basis for a finding of excessive force by SO #1 or SO #2. The officers intervened quickly and quite properly to prevent a potentially extremely dangerous situation which resulted, unfortunately, in the Complainant’s serious injury. Consequently, I am satisfied that the actions of the involved officers fell well within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. As a result, no charges will issue and this case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-033
2017,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Waterloo,Ontario, Because of the Complainant’s obvious facial injuries an ambulance attended and took the Complainant to the hospital where it was determined that he had suffered multiple facial fractures including fractures of his nasal and orbital bones,"As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by both the SO and WO #1 fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-093
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,"On November\xa030,\xa02016 the Complainant was seen in the emergency room in a hospital in Kingston and was diagnosed with a fractured right elbow","In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which she suffered, even were I to find that the officers caused the injury, which I am not inclined to do. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-040
2017,London Police Service,London,Ontario," The Complainant was transported by ambulance to the hospital and was treated for two fractured collar bones bilateral pulmonary hemorrhagefootnote 3[3 bilateral rib fractures bilateral pneumothorax,footnote 4[4 and a non-displaced fractured vertebra","In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code, the HTA and the Ontario Police Services Act, but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently and with good common sense. I cannot find any criticism whatsoever of the SO’s actions but rather I would commend him for his calm and level headed approach to CW #6’s behaviour, and as such, find that there is no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-300
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario, The Complainant was taken to hospital by ambulance where it was determined that he had sustained numerous life threatening injuries including significant spinal canal injuries fractures in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spines bilateral elbow dislocations and forearm fractures bilaterally chest injuries including a fractured breast bone liver spleen and bowel injuries and pelvic injuries including a pelvic fracture,"On a review of all of the evidence, I find that the Complainant’s injuries were caused by his own actions without any involvement by the police. All of the police officers who responded to CW #6’s 911 call indicating that the Complainant was attempting to throw CW #3 from the fourth floor balcony were lawfully carrying out their duties as required when they attended and attempted, if possible, to prevent any injury to either of CW #3 or the Complainant from occurring. At no time did any officer have any physical contact with the Complainant and any verbal interaction, according to all civilian witnesses present, was of the nature to discourage the Complainant from jumping and to encourage him to go back inside his apartment. None of the communications between the Complainant and police as overheard by witnesses could in any way have been seen to initiate the actions of the Complainant. Although the intentions of the Complainant, in climbing over the balcony railing, are unknown, it is clear that he fell or jumped as a result of his own actions without any assistance or encouragement from any of the police officers present. The actions of the Complainant were described by all present as being voluntary and without any obvious provocation. We will, of course, never know what was going on in the Complainant’s mind that would lead him to take the action that he did, but there can be no doubt that no fault lies with any of the police officers responding, who were merely carrying out their duties as they are required to do. It is notable that at no time were any allegations made against these officers by anyone, with respect to any inappropriate actions on their part, and I am satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-028
2017,Stratford Police Service,Head,Ontario, The Complainant was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with a lumbar vertebra fracture,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding any injury which he may have suffered, even were I to find that the SO caused the injury, which I am not inclined to do.

2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Sioux Lookout,Ontario,He was later airlifted to the hospital in Thunder Bay where it was determined he had a significant head injury with intracranial bleeding including fractures to his right and left eye sockets and to the nasal bone,"In conclusion, on all of the available evidence, I am unable to find that there are any reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence was committed by any police officer in this instance and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-101
2017,St. Thomas Police Service,Head,Ontario,The Complainant returned to the hospital several days later and was diagnosed with a fractured bone in his right ear,"In the final analysis, while the injury to the Complainant was unfortunate, I am satisfied that it was not the result intended by the SO, but rather was an unfortunate result of the resistance and struggling of the Complainant. On these facts, I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-022
2017,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,Complainant\xa0#2 also attended the hospital and was diagnosed with a possible fractured nose,"On all of the evidence, and as is clearly confirmed by the BT CCTV video, as well as the statements of all three of the civilian witnesses, both Complainant #1 and the SO were the victims of an unfortunate motor vehicle collision directly caused by the failure of the driver of the unidentified SUV to yield the right of way to Complainant #2, forcing Complainant #2 to take split second evasive action, which resulted in his striking both Complainant #1’s Toyota and the SO’s police cruiser. There is no question that no fault whatsoever lies with either of Complainant #1 or the SO and there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any actions on the part of the SO contributed in any way to the collision or the subsequent injuries sustained by both Complainant #1 and Complainant #2. As such, there is no basis on this evidence to consider any criminal charges again the SO and none will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-114
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario, The Complainant was transported to hospital by ambulance and diagnosed with a right distal fibula comminuted fracture fractured ankle,"I find on this evidence that the driving of the SO in his pursuit and attempt to apprehend the Complainant does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and even less so “a marked and substantial departure from the norm” and I am unable to establish that there was a causal connection between the actions of the pursuing officers and the motor vehicle collision that caused the Complainant’s injury. As such, although the SO was clearly in breach of the regulations requiring him to immediately notify the Communications Operator of the vehicle’s failure to stop and keep them informed, and for failing to have his siren continually activated during the pursuit, I find that there is insufficient evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed and no basis for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tvi-109
2017,Windsor Police Service,,Ontario,The Complainant was formed under the Mental Health Act MHA)footnote 1[1 and kept for assessment,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injuries which he suffered, which were found not only to have been self-inflicted but to have occurred prior to any interaction with police. Furthermore, I have no hesitation in finding on this record that the actions exercised by the officers not only fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law, but that the officers exhibited good judgment, patience and professionalism throughout and their actions were critical in bringing this matter to a successful conclusion. I also find that the actions of all of the responding officers were in compliance with police policies and best practices with respect to the treatment of persons in mental health crises and were commendable. As such, there is absolutely no basis for the laying of criminal charges here and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-081
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario, The next day the Complainant felt dizzy and attended the hospital again where he was diagnosed with acute comminuted fractures of the anterior wall of the right maxillary sinus and left zygomatic process facial orbital bones,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the actions of SO #1 and SO #2 in removing the Complainant’s hold on SO #1’s firearm, and the manner in which they did so, were lawful notwithstanding the injuries which the Complainant suffered. I believe it is fortunate that the firearm did not accidentally discharge and that the Complainant was not shot as he held onto the barrel of SO #1’s firearm and struggled with him over the control of his rifle. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by SO #1 and SO #2 fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-131
2017,London Police Service,,Ontario,It was determined that the Complainant had an acute ulnar shaft fracture of the left wrist,"In conclusion, while I believe that the Complainant likely suffered a fracture to his left wrist during his encounter with the police officers on January 17, 2017, I am satisfied that the Complainant was lawfully under arrest and that the force used by the involved officers during the encounter fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. I therefore have no reasonable grounds to believe a criminal offence was committed. Accordingly, no charges will issue and this case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-017
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,The Complainant was the passenger in the Corolla and sustained pulmonary contusions and a sternal fracture from the impact,"I find on this evidence that the driving of the SO while following the Camry does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and even less so “a marked and substantial departure from the norm” and I find that there is no causal connection between the actions of the SO and the motor vehicle collision that caused the Complainant’s injuries. In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code, the HTA, the TPS Policy on Suspect Apprehension Pursuits and the Ontario Police Services Actfootnote 2[2], but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently and with good common sense and, as such, I find that there is absolutely no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tvi-029
2017,Niagara Regional Police Service,Strong,Ontario,He was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a fractured left hip,"The totality of the evidence leads me to the conclusion that both the SO and WO #1 were justified in the amount of force they applied to subdue the Complainant, given his resistance and their lawful authority to arrest him. I have significant concerns with the reliability of the Complainant’s statement and find that there was nothing in the conduct of the SO that would attract criminal liability. Accordingly, I cannot form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence was committed in this case and therefore, no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-030
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,He was transported by ambulance to the hospital and was diagnosed with a broken nasal bone,"As indicated earlier, I find that it was the combination of the Complainant’s pulling away, combined with the SO’s reaction in releasing his arm, which increased the momentum of the Complainant’s resistance, causing him to fall to the floor. The jurisprudence is clear, officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)) nor should they be judged to a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206). As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that he committed a criminal offence and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-077
2017,Peel Regional Police,,Ontario, The Complainant was taken to the hospital and it was determined that he sustained a fracture of his left orbital bone and a comminuted fracture of the anterior wall of the left antrum,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officer fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-036
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,"He was diagnosed with fractures of ribs\xa0#1,\xa0#2 and\xa0#3 near his left shoulder and to ribs\xa0#C7 on the left side of his spinal column","On all of the evidence, it is clear that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the SO, immediately prior to the collision between his car door and the bicycle and person of the Complainant, did not take the necessary precautions when he opened his door into bicycle traffic and thereby caused the injuries to the Complainant. At most, however, it can be said that the SO showed a momentary lack of attention or he was careless in opening his door without first ensuring that the way was clear and that he therein contravened the provisions of s.165 of the HTA. Generally, where a HTA offence completely encompasses the actions complained of, the actions will not generally attract Criminal Code sanctions without something more; either a combination of one or more infractions of the HTA, or actions so egregious that they go beyond the HTA into the realm of criminal sanctions. In this case, there is no evidence that the SO’s actions were such that they would constitute “a marked and substantial departure from the norm” nor is there any evidence that he exhibited “a reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others”. As indicated above, a breach of the HTA does not, in and of itself, rise to the level required to make out a criminal offence without something more, and while the SO may have been responsible for the collision and the Complainant’s subsequent serious injuries, I cannot find reasonable grounds to believe that any criminal offence was committed here. With respect to a charge under the HTA, that is not within my mandate and I will leave that to the Chief of the Toronto Police Service to pursue such a charge if he deems it appropriate.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tvi-298
2017,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Kitchener,Ontario,The Complainant sustained a fractured skull and compound fractures to his left tibia and fibula,"On this record, I find that the evidence of the SO’s driving does not rise to the level required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and, as indicated earlier, there is no evidence to support a causal connection between the actions of the SO and the collision and consequent injuries caused by CW #14. While it may be that the SO only abandoned his police pursuit because CW #14 accelerated away from him and was lost from sight, CW #14 was only able to do so because the SO put public safety ahead of his desire to apprehend CW #14. In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code, the Highway Traffic Act and the Ontario Police Services Act, but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently and with good common sense and, as such, I find that there is no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovi-018
2017,Windsor Police Service,Windsor,Ontario,"The Complainant was removed from life support and she was declared dead on September\xa019,\xa02017 at 9:34\xa0p","I therefore find that there is no basis on this evidence to believe, on reasonable grounds, that any of the police officers who interacted with the Complainant on September 4th, 2017, resorted to any unjustified or excessive force in dealing with her, nor is there any evidence that their actions in any way contributed to her death and there are therefore no grounds for the laying of criminal charges and none will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ood-267
2017,,Durham,Ontario,The Complainant was pronounced dead at the scene,"On this record, there is no causal connection between the actions of the SO and the tragic death of the Complainant, nor is there any basis for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ovd-015
2017,Kingston Police,Kingston,Ontario,The Complainant was declared dead at the scene,"It is clear that the Complainant took his own life without any intervention by the police. It is confirmed, both by the throw phone video and the three independent witnesses, that no police officer entered the Complainant’s home, nor were any firearms discharged by police officers, prior to the fatal gunshot by the Complainant’s own hand. It would be speculative to assume, had police officers acted with less caution and more quickly, that his life could have been saved at the risk of the loss of other human life, but it was ultimately the Complainant who decided that he should end his own life rather than be arrested and taken to jail. Despite the tragic loss of life, the police officers tasked with this incident followed all procedures as set out in their policy guidelines and cannot be held responsible for the Complainant’s actions in fulfilling his intention to end his own life. As such, there are no reasonable grounds here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-067
2017,York Regional Police,Head,Ontario, The Complainant was examined later that day at the hospital and it was determined that he had sustained a fracture through the floor of the left orbit,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-016
2016,Peterborough Police Service,Horton,Ontario,His injuries consisted of a basal skull fracture nasal bone fracture left sphenoid and temporal bone fractures and a comminuted fracture of the left temporal bone as well as fractures of the left lateral sphenoid clivus and carotid canal,"On a review of all of the evidence, it is clear that no police officer was involved in the Complainant’s fall and his subsequent injuries. The SO, WO #1 and WO #3 were carrying out their duties as required in searching for and speaking with the Complainant and CW #1, in order to further their investigation, when the Complainant fell and was seriously injured. On a review of the record, I can find no evidence to indicate that the Complainant’s fall was anything other than an unfortunate accident possibly brought about by his own significant state of impairment and there are no reasonable grounds to find that any criminal offence has been committed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-252
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,He was diagnosed with a fracture through the right nasal bone with proximal and superior depression,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the actions of the TPS officers in subduing the Complainant in the interview room and lodging him in the cell thereafter were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-061
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,The Complainant was transported by ambulance to the hospital where he was diagnosed with having a fractured left orbital bone,"As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-075
2016,York Regional Police,,Ontario,The Complainant sustained a fractured left ankle,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied on this record that the SO and WO #1 were acting lawfully when they first attempted to stop the Audi to investigate a number of obvious HTA infractions and that their conduct thereafter fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law. They not only fully followed the letter of the law with respect to Suspect Apprehension Pursuits, but they also scrupulously followed the intent of the legislation. Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges against these police officers.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ovi-292
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,It was determined that she sustained a fracture of the mid-shaft of her left clavicle,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and arrest and the manner in which they were carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which she suffered. I also find that in making the conscious decision to flee from police, rather than stop when directed by them to do so, the Complainant brought about the series of events which caused the SO to have to chase her in an attempt to stop her, which ultimately led to her injury. Had she chosen to stop when directed, her unfortunate injury would surely have been avoided. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the police officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-063
2016,Peel Regional Police,,Ontario,He was transported to hospital and was diagnosed with a fractured ninth left rib,"Before closing, however, I would strongly recommend to the Chief of the Peel Regional Police that both of these police officers receive additional training and are counseled with respect to dealing with these types of situations and would hope that in future, rather than putting a lone police officer at great risk by sending him into a dark and confined area with a possibly violent offender, they will choose to call for back up and possibly have the Emergency Task Force attend to deal with the situation, as they are more than adequately trained and equipped to do.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-188
2016,,Hamilton,Ontario,At approximately 2:00 a.m on September 3 2016 the Complainant was driving a newly purchased motorcycle without a licence plate eastbound across Main Street West in Hamilton The Complainant was travelling at a high rate of speed and did a wheelie when he caught the attention of the SO and WO 1 who were parked in a marked HPS cruiser facing east on Main Street West As the Complainant approached the cruiser he slowed and passed it in the middle lane The SO pulled in behind the motorcycle at the red light at the intersection of Main Street West and Queen Street South When the light turned green the Complainant sped eastbound on Main Street West but then stopped for a red light at the intersection of Main Street West and Hess Street South The Complainant weaved his way to the front of the stopped vehicles and when the light turned green the Complainant sped away again The SO did not pursue the Complainant The Complainant continued across Main Street West at a high rate of speed and ran the red light at the intersection of Bay Street South and Main Street West as well as the next two red lights At the intersection of Main Street West and James Street South the Complainant again sped into the intersection against the red light and struck a pick-up truck that was travelling southbound on a green light The Complainant had struck the pick-up truck’s passenger side rear quarter panel After the collision the Complainant and his motorcycle skidded across the intersection on the ground and came to rest just east of the intersection Emergency Medical Services EMS attended and the Complainant was taken to the hospital but was declared deceased at 3:01\xa0a.m,"It is my opinion that the SO was not involved in a police pursuit. At no point did the SO signal to the Complainant to stop his motorcycle prior to the collision after which the emergency lights of the police cruiser were activated. Nor did the SO at any point engage in the sort of aggressive driving which might suggest that he was trying to catch and stop the Complainant. In the final analysis, I am therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on the record that the actions exercised by the SO fell well within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ovd-255
2017,Hamilton Police Service,,Ontario,It was determined that the Complainant had sustained a comminuted nasal bone fracture associated with soft tissue hematoma and laceration of the upper lip,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered, that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law, and that there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-065
2016,Hamilton Police Service,,Ontario, The Complainant was transported to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a non-displaced fracture to her left scapula,"As such, I find that the evidence of the SO’s driving does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and, as indicated earlier, there is no evidence to support a causal connection between the actions of the SO and the motor vehicle collision caused by CW #1 entering the intersection. In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code, the HTA and the OPSA, but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently and with good common sense. I cannot find any criticism of the SO’s actions and, as such, find that there is absolutely no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ovi-318
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,The cause of death was determined to be from a blunt impact head injury following a descent from a height,"On this evidence, it is clear that nothing that any of the police officers said or did provoked the Complainant to jump to her death; on the contrary, it appears from all of the evidence that the Complainant was determined to end her life and no amount of police intervention was going to change her mind. It also appears that as soon as police and paramedics arrived, before they could really say or do anything to dissuade or assist the Complainant, the Complainant decided she needed to immediately run from police in order to thwart their attempts to intercede and to jump to her death before anyone could prevent her from doing so. On this basis, despite the tragic outcome for the Complainant, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that there is no causal connection between the actions of police and the death of the Complainant and that police acted expeditiously and diligently in their efforts to respond to the 911 call and to attempt to locate the Complainant and prevent her death. As such, I find there is no basis here to establish any reasonable grounds to believe that any criminal offence was committed here and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tcd-001
2017,Halton Regional Police Service,Head,Ontario,The SO WO\xa0#1 and WO\xa0#3 rushed to the Complainant and she was taken by ambulance to hospital but was pronounced dead at 4:30\xa0p,"On this basis, despite the tragic outcome for the Complainant, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the actions exercised by the SO, and all of the police officers who attended to attempt to prevent the suicide of the Complainant, fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-ocd-045
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,X-rays revealed that the Complainant sustained acute non-displaced left 9th and 10th lateral rib fractures and a non-displaced nasal bone fracture,"Although it is quite possible that the punches to the Complainant’s face were the cause of his fractured nose, and that SO #1 falling on top of the Complainant with his full weight may have caused the non-displaced fractures of the Complainant’s ninth and tenth ribs, I cannot find that their actions in these circumstances, even if they caused the injuries, were an excessive use of force. On the facts before me, where both police officers had information that the Complainant may have ingested a lethal dose of a drug, there was clearly some urgency to get him subdued and to a hospital where he could receive treatment as soon as possible. It is clear that initially both police officers made every effort to get the Complainant the help he needed through encouragement and reason, with the hopes that he would voluntarily go to hospital. When that failed and the Complainant ran off, I find that SO #1 and SO #2 were fully justified in using force to apprehend the Complainant not only to protect themselves from the Complainant, but to protect the Complainant himself. I find that the actions of both police officers progressed in a measured and proportionate fashion to meet and overcome the Complainant’s resistance and combative behaviour, and fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to affect his lawful apprehension. While I do not discount the possibility that the Complainant may have been injured when he jumped from his balcony,footnote 3[3] even if his injuries were caused by the efforts of the officers to subdue the Complainant, I cannot find that to have been an excessive use of force. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-012
2016,Peel Regional Police,Head,Ontario,Complainant\xa0#2 was also taken to hospital and assessed as having sustained fractured ribs and bruising to his heart,"On this record, I find that the evidence of the SO’s driving does not rise to the level required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and, as indicated earlier, there is no evidence to support a causal connection between the actions of the SO and the motor vehicle collision caused by the Nissan. In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code, the Highway Traffic Act and the Ontario Police Services Act, but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently and with good common sense. As such, I find that there is absolutely no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ovi-326
2017,,Hamilton,Ontario, The next day the Complainant attended the hospital and was diagnosed as having two dislocated toes and a broken bone in his right foot,"On this evidence, it is clear that the Complainant was actively resisting the best efforts of the officers to ensure that he was safely lodged in the cruiser and transported to the station. Despite the actions of the officers, the Complainant somehow managed to place his right foot in harm’s way after the officers had successfully shoved him back and fully into the cruiser and closed the door. On this record, I find that the injuries to the Complainant were caused by his own actions, either when kicking the door or when placing his foot in the path of the cruiser door as it was being closed; that the SO in all likelihood did not see the location of the Complainant’s right foot, as it was not visible from his vantage point outside the car; and that the Complainant’s injuries were as a result of his own behaviour which lead to an unfortunate injury. As such, there is no basis for finding that reasonable grounds exist for the laying of criminal charges and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-043
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,London,Ontario,He was taken by ambulance to the hospital where it was determined he had suffered a fracture to his left heel,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the police officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-041
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,As soon as the SO opened the apartment door however the Complainant jumped from his balcony falling to his death,"On this evidence it is clear that nothing that the SO, WO #1 or WO #2 said or did provoked the Complainant to jump to his death, on the contrary, it appears from all of the evidence that the Complainant was intent on ending his life and no amount of police intervention was going to change his mind. We will, of course, never know what was going on in the Complainant’s mind at the moment that he fell or jumped from his balcony, but there can be no doubt that no fault lies with the police officers who were merely carrying out their duties as they are required to do and were unfortunately unable to intercede to prevent the death of the Complainant. It appears from the Complainant’s actions, in leaving the balcony as soon as the door of his apartment opened but before the police officers could say or do anything, that the Complainant had decided he needed to immediately jump to his death before anyone could prevent him from doing so. On this basis, despite the tragic outcome for the Complainant, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the actions exercised by the SO, WO #1 and WO #2 fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tcd-055
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,Sioux Lookout,Ontario,X-rays determined that the Complainant had a minimally displaced left 4th and 5th rib fracture,"In conclusion, I find on the credible evidence of the CW, as fully corroborated by the SO and WO #1, that no force other than the minimal amount required to assist the Complainant to his feet and into the police cruiser was used by either police officer during his interaction with the Complainant on October 11th, 2016, and that there are no reasonable grounds upon which to believe that either police officer employed an excessive use of force against the Complainant, nor that they were the cause of his injuries and, as such, there is no evidence upon which to base a reasonable belief that a criminal offence was committed here.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-118
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,An x-ray determined that the Complainant had sustained an oblique fracture through the left distal clavicle,"I find on this evidence that the driving of the SO, while he was involved in the pursuit and attempt to apprehend CW #1, does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and even less so “a marked and substantial departure from the norm” and I am unable to establish that there was a causal connection between the actions of the pursuing police officers and the motor vehicle collision that caused the Complainant’s injury. As such, I find that there is insufficient evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed and no basis for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tvi-035
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,A computed tomography CT scan revealed that the Complainant sustained a comminuted nasal bone fracture and non-displaced right medial orbital wall fracture,"In my view, there is no evidentiary basis for a finding of excessive force by the SO. To the contrary, I find that both he and WO #1 showed restraint in the amount of force applied given that the Complainant confronted them with what appeared to be a firearm. Consequently, I am satisfied that the actions of the involved officers fell well within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. As a result, no charges will issue and this case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-011
2017,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Kitchener,Ontario, A CT scan was taken of the Complainant’s head and showed that he suffered a displaced fracture to his left orbital bone,"In conclusion, while I believe that the Complainant suffered damage to his left orbital bone during his encounter with WRPS on January 12, 2017, I am satisfied that the Complainant was lawfully under arrest and that the force applied by the SO to the left side of his face fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. I therefore have no reasonable grounds to believe a criminal offence was committed. Accordingly, this case will be closed and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-010
2017,York Regional Police,,Ontario,He was examined and diagnosed with a broken nose,"On these facts, although I find that the Complainant’s injury was caused by the police officers either when the Complainant was taken to the ground or when the SO delivered a distractionary elbow strike which inadvertently struck the Complainant in the face, I find that pursuant to section 25(1) of the Criminal Code, the police officers involved used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the execution of their lawful duties in apprehending an intoxicated, combative and resistant man and that the force used by them was no more than was required to protect themselves from the Complainant and to subdue and handcuff him. As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the police officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-049
2017,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario, the Complainant was pronounced dead,"In conclusion, having extensively reviewed all of the evidence before me, I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal act was committed by any police officer in his dealings with the Complainant on September 5, 1982, or conclude on reasonable grounds that any police officer was responsible for, or contributed to, the death of the Complainant, as a result of which, no criminal charges will follow.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tcd-047
2017,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,X-rays confirmed that he had sustained bilateral nasal bone fractures,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury or injuries which he suffered. I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tci-008
2016,Guelph Police Service,,Ontario,When the Complainant returned to hospital three days later an x-ray confirmed that he had sustained a fractured orbital bone,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-313
2017,Ottawa Police Service,Ottawa,Ontario,He was later taken to the hospital and was diagnosed with a fracture to the left ankle,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s arrest, and the manner in which it was carried out, was lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered, even were I to find that the officers caused the injury, which I am unable to conclude on this evidence. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-002
2016,North Bay Police Service,,Ontario,An ambulance was called and the Complainant was transported to hospital where he was diagnosed with a fractured pelvis,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and the manner in which it was carried out was lawful notwithstanding the injury which he may have suffered during his arrest (although I am not at all convinced that the injury was due to the SO’s actions). I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-172
2017,Ottawa Police Service,Ottawa,Ontario, The mechanism to cause this injury was opined as not needing to be significant and could have occurred from a squeeze of the wrist contact with metal such as handcuffs or the rails of the gurney or from a fall,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and the manner in which it was carried out was lawful notwithstanding the injury which she may have suffered, even were I to find that the officers caused the injury, which is speculative at best. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell well within the limits prescribed by the criminal law, that they used no more than the absolute minimum force required to protect the Complainant from harm, and that their actions, which exhibited patience, caring, and consideration of the state of crisis in which the Complainant found herself, were not only acceptable, but were commendable in the circumstances. On these facts, there is not a shred of evidence upon which I could form reasonable grounds to believe that these police officers committed a criminal act and there are therefore no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-151
2017,Peel Regional Police,Head,Ontario,Once at the hospital an x-ray revealed that the Complainant sustained a lumbar fracture of the L1 and L2 vertebrae and a non-displaced right sacral facture a fracture of the sacrum a large triangular bone at the bottom of the spine,"On this evidence, although I find that the Complainant’s injuries were caused by a police officer and were as a direct result of her falling due to the deployment of the CEW, I cannot find this to have been an excessive use of force. On the contrary, I find that the SO, in assessing the situation and his use of force options, at all times acted prudently, responsibly and in the best interests of both the Complainant and the safety of his fellow police officers and the community. In short, the SO used good common sense to alleviate the danger posed by the Complainant without causing unnecessary harm to her in the process. For the foregoing reasons, I can find no evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that any criminal offence was committed here by the SO, or any police officer involved in the apprehension of the Complainant, and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-025
2016,York Regional Police,East Gwillimbury,Ontario, The Complainant was transported to hospital where an x-ray of the Complainant’s right hand was taken and indicated that he suffered a displaced fracture to his right fifth metacarpal pinky finger,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding any injury which he may suffered, even were I to find that the officers caused any such injury, which I am not inclined to do. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-190
2017,Halton Regional Police Service,,Ontario,The Complainant was later taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a perforated tympanic membrane in his left ear ruptured ear drum,"On the basis of the foregoing, I find that the injury suffered by the Complainant was an unfortunate accident that was completely unforeseeable, that the DD was deployed without any intention on the part of the SO to use force against the Complainant and that there is no evidence that the SO was even aware of the presence of the Complainant. As such, I find that there is an absence of any reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed here and I am satisfied that there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-009
2016,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,A CT scan was done and the Complainant was diagnosed with a “minor head injury”footnote 2[2 and instructed to seek further medical attention if he felt it necessary,"As such, I am therefore satisfied on this record that the actions of the subject officers – SO #1, SO #2 and SO #3 – fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and thus conclude there are no grounds to believe that a criminal offence was committed. Accordingly, no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-323
2016,Ottawa Police Service,Ottawa,Ontario,"On June\xa015,\xa02016 the Complainant re-attended the hospital where an x-ray of his bilateral rib revealed a healing or a healed fracture through the posterior aspect of his right 10th rib","Accordingly, I am unable to form reasonable grounds to believe that SO #1 and SO #2 committed a criminal offence in relation to their interactions with the Complainant on February 19, 2016. As a result, no charges will issue and this case will be closed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-116
2016,Peel Regional Police,Brampton,Ontario,An ambulance was called and he was taken to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken orbital bone and nasal bone,"Accepting, then, that the Complainant’s injuries were caused when he was removed from the BMW through the driver’s window and fell to the ground, I find that the officers used no more force than necessary to affect their lawful purpose. The jurisprudence is clear that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)) nor should they be judged to a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206). On this record, it is clear that the force used by the SO, WO #4 and WO #5, given the dynamic nature of the arrest and the danger caused by the BMW trying to escape the police block, fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to affect the Complainant’s lawful detention, notwithstanding the injury he suffered as a result. Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case, and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-310
2016,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,The subsequent autopsy concluded that the Complainant suffered from cardiomyopathy heart muscle disease and gene mutation associated with cardiomyopathy and that condition coupled with cocaine intoxication caused the Complainant’s death,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding his tragic death, which appears to have been inevitable based on his pre-existing heart condition combined with his ingestion of a toxic level of cocaine. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the SO fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tcd-276
2016,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,"On November\xa028,\xa02016 the Complainant filed a complaint with OIPRD alleging that he had been beaten by the attending officers during his arrest causing his injury","I find on the record before me that the evidence falls far short of the standard of reasonable grounds to believe any officer committed an offence of Assault Causing Bodily Harm contrary to the Criminal Code, in this instance. I find that there is sufficient credible evidence that the Complainant suffered his broken toe prior to the arrival of police that I am left without any reasonable grounds to believe that there is a causal connection between the Complainant’s injury and the actions of police. Having rejected the evidence of the Complainant and CW #1, I am unable, on the remaining evidence, to find reasonable grounds to believe that any of the police officers who attended exercised an excessive use of force in their attempts to arrest the Complainant or that the actions of police were the source of the Complainant’s injury and thus there are no grounds to believe a criminal offence was committed by any of the police officers and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-304
2016,,Windsor,Ontario,At the hospital the Complainant complained of pain in her left elbow and an x-ray of the Complainant’s left elbow revealed a fracture which was subsequently confirmed by a CT scan,"Accordingly, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the SO and WO #1 used such force as was reasonably necessary to apprehend the Complainant under the MHA, notwithstanding the injury which she may have suffered. The jurisprudence is clear that while police officers’ actions must be commensurate with the task at hand, they cannot be expected to measure their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)) or to be judged against a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206). I have no reasonable basis to believe that either police officer committed a criminal offence and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-303
2017,Peel Regional Police,Head,Ontario, Because of his visible injuries the Complainant was transported to hospital where it was determined that he had sustained a fractured nose and a fractured eighth right rib,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injuries which he suffered. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the police officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-003
2016,Brantford Police Service,Head,Ontario,Complainant\xa0#1 was pronounced dead at the hospital at approximately 11:20\xa0a,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied on this record that the SO was acting lawfully when he first attempted to stop the Nissan in an attempt to execute his warrant and that his conduct thereafter fell within the limits of care prescribed by the criminal law. Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges against the officer.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ovd-278
2016,Peel Regional Police,Head,Ontario,They informed the PRP officers that the complainant had undiagnosed mental health issues had threatened to commit suicide in the past and had just attacked CW 1 inside the apartment and threatened to kill him,"In the final analysis, I have no hesitancy in concluding that the actions of the involved PRP officers were conducted throughout in a manner that was professional, responsive and reasoned. In this respect, it is significant to note that it was the opinion of CW #1 that the PRP officers only entered the apartment to speak with the complainant, that they had no chance to communicate with the complainant before he jumped and that they did nothing that he considered to be wrong. Accordingly, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that any offence has been committed by the SO and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ocd-238
2016,Toronto Police Service,Huron,Ontario, An ambulance was called and the Complainant was transported to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a fractured left forearm,"On a review of the record in this case, there is no evidence that the officers used any force to apprehend the Complainant, other than the very minimal force required to place the handcuffs onto the Complainant, which were immediately removed when he complained of pain. What is clear on all of the evidence from all witnesses is that the bottle of wine came through this ordeal unscathed and undamaged. I find that the Complainant, in attempting to flee from the officers in his state of extreme intoxication and for the sole purpose of protecting his alcohol, caused the injury to himself without any intervention by police. It is notable that at no time were any allegations made against these officers by any of the four independent civilian witnesses who observed the interaction between the officers and the Complainant, with respect to any inappropriate actions on their part and I am satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell well within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-199
2016,North Bay Police Service,,Ontario, Within minutes of the officers leaving the Complainant fell to his death from an 8th floor window in the building,"The Complainant’s death was a tragedy. However, to attempt to determine the Complainant’s motivations at the time he jumped would be speculative. Moreover, there is no evidence to indicate that the SO or WO #1 bore any criminal responsibility for the Complainant’s ultimate decision. To the contrary, the Complainant was the author of his own ending when he jumped from an 8th floor window and descended almost 20 metres to the ground below. Nothing from the investigation suggested that the involved officers were anything less than professional and attentive during the incident involving the Complainant. Accordingly, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been committed and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ocd-302
2016,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario, The Complainant was transported to hospital where he was diagnosed with a collapsed left lung and fractures of the left 8th 9th and 10th ribs,"Although it is regrettable that the Complainant received significant injuries during the execution of the search warrant, I am not satisfied on this record for the foregoing reasons that the actions of SO #1 and SO #2 fell outside the limits prescribed by the criminal law. Accordingly, I am unable to form reasonable ground to believe that a criminal offence has been committed and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-186
2016,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,Just before 5:30 a.m on July 24 2016 the Complainant was inside CW 2’s apartment and shot her in the upper thigh and himself in the abdomen The Complainant and CW 2 then left the apartment and CW called 911 once they were outside The Complainant told the 911 operator that she and the Complainant had been shot Within minutes of the Complainant and CW\xa0#2 going outside the building TEMS and TFS personnel arrived followed by TPS officers In full view of the emergency personnel and officers the Complainant held his firearm to his temple and fired one shot None of the officers had spoken to or approached or had their firearms drawn at the Complainant at the time The Complainant was taken to hospital and pronounced deceased from a single gunshot wound to the head,"On this record, I find that the Complainant’s death was caused by his own actions without any direct involvement by the police officers present; that officers present were carrying out their duties as required in responding to the 911 call; and that at no time did any officer have either any physical contact nor any verbal interaction with the Complainant that could in any way have been seen to initiate the actions of the Complainant. On a review of all of the evidence, it is clear that no officer unholstered his firearm until after the sound of the gunshot that caused the Complainant’s death and further, on the evidence of the emergency personnel at the scene, no police officer was in close proximity to the Complainant at the time of the gunshot nor were they in a position to have fired the shot, since emergency personnel were standing between police and the Complainant. The actions of the Complainant were clearly without warning or provocation and were completely unforeseen to any emergency or police personnel present. We will, of course, never know definitively what was going on in the Complainant’s mind that would lead him to take such a drastic and lethal action, but there can be no doubt that no fault lies with any of the police officers present, who were merely carrying out their duties as they are required to do. It is notable that at no time were any allegations made against these officers by anyone, with respect to any inappropriate actions on their part and I am satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tcd-192
2016,Toronto Police Service,Midland,Ontario,Her cause of death was determined to be due to blunt force injuries consistent with a descent from a height,"On all of the evidence, it is without dispute that when police officers arrived at the Complainant’s unit, they announced themselves as police, their only request was that the Complainant come out and speak with them and that they never breached the door or entered the apartment prior to the Complainant taking her own life. We will, of course, never know what was going on in the Complainant’s mind that would lead her to take such a drastic and fatal action, but there can be no doubt that no fault lies with SO #1 and SO #2, who were merely carrying out their duties as they are required to do. It is further notable that at no time were any allegations made against these police officers, by anyone, with respect to any inappropriate actions on their part and that they immediately responded when they received the information that the Complainant may have jumped, called for ambulance and police assistance, and initiated lifesaving efforts. On all of the evidence, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that there is no causal connection between the actions of the responding police and TCHC officers and the death of the Complainant. I am further satisfied that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tcd-319
2017,,,Ontario, The Complainant complained of pain in his back and was transported to hospital where he was diagnosed with a stable compression fracture of the L2 vertebrae,"It is notable that at no time were any allegations made against these officers by anyone, with respect to any inappropriate actions on their part. On this record, I am satisfied that the officers used the minimal amount of force required to handcuff the Complainant and that the Complainant alone caused his injury by going out of a second floor window and falling backward onto the asphalt below. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-oci-095
2016,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario, As the Complainant had visible facial injuries he was transported to hospital and was diagnosed as having sustained a mild nasal bone fracture,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on all of the available evidence that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-244
2016,Hamilton Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario, The Complainant later complained of pain to his ribs and was taken to hospital where an x-ray confirmed a non-displaced fracture of the left side tenth rib,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s apprehension, and the manner in which it was carried out, was lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the police officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-325
2016,York Regional Police,Markham,Ontario, An ambulance transported the Complainant to hospital where it was determined that he sustained a closed head injury severely displaced mandible jaw fractures and a lacerated liver,"On a review of all of the evidence, I find that there is no evidence that the driving of the SO created a danger to other users of the roadway or that at any time did he interfere with other traffic; in fact, other than his initial high rate of speed in his attempt to catch up to the Complainant’s vehicle, it does not appear that he contravened any provision of the Highway Traffic Act; additionally the environmental conditions were good and the roads were dry. As such, I find that the evidence of the SO’s driving does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and, as indicated earlier, there is no evidence to support a causal connection between the actions of the SO and the motor vehicle collision caused by the Complainant. In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code, the Highway Traffic Act and the Ontario Police Services Act, but he behaved at all times professionally and prudently. As such, I find that there is absolutely no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ovi-293
2016,Niagara Regional Police Service,Head,Ontario, The next day the Complainant was transported to the hospital and diagnosed with an acute concussion,"Accordingly, I am satisfied that the SO’s strike of the Complainant’s head during his and WO #1’s efforts to handcuff the Complainant was reasonably necessary given her size and violent behaviour towards herself and the police officers once it became clear that she was going to be arrested. The Complainant was out of control, kicking at the police officers, attempting to cut her wrists with broken plastic, and squirming and resisting even once she was on the floor. The Complainant’s resistant behaviour continued after she was handcuffed, as she struck her head against the wall as she was led out of the home, and bit parts of the police cruiser once she was placed inside. The jurisprudence is clear that while police officers’ actions must be commensurate with the task at hand, they cannot be expected to measure their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)) or to be judged against a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206). Given that, and the evidence described above, I have no reasonable basis to believe that the SO committed a criminal offence and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-297
2016,Peel Regional Police,,Ontario,He was diagnosed with a right orbital floor blowout fracture,"Finally, I have considered whether the offences of criminal negligence or failure to provide the necessities of life were made out in this case. While the decision of WO #1 and WO #2 to remove the Complainant from the backyard by putting him over the fence while handcuffed with his hands behind his back was ill-advised and not well considered, it does not reach the level of being a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in the circumstances, let alone amount to a wanton and reckless disregard for the well-being of an individual such that an offence of criminal negligence causing bodily harm might be made out.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-317
2016,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,He was released with instructions to follow for monitoring for a possible head injury,"Accordingly, I do not have reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has occurred and no charges will be laid.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-261
2016,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,X-rays revealed he had a fractured orbital bone,"As such, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that the SO’s actions fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds to believe he committed a criminal offence. No charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-298
2016,Greater Sudbury Police Service,Head,Ontario,An x-ray of his right elbow showed there was no fracture or dislocation,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered, even were I to find that the officers caused the injury, which I am not inclined to do. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the police officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and thus no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-321
2016,Peel Regional Police,Mississauga,Ontario,At the hospital the Complainant was diagnosed with a fractured right ankle and received four staples to close cuts on his head,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injuries which he suffered. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the police officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-257
2016,,,Ontario,He was diagnosed with subtle fractures of the right orbital floor nondisplaced,"In the circumstances, I find that such punches were necessary and reasonable given the other options available to the SO. The jurisprudence is clear that police officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)) nor should they be judged to a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206). On the facts set out above, the force used by the SO fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to effect the Complainant’s lawful detention, notwithstanding the injury he suffered as a result. Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case, and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-311
2016,Toronto Police Service,King,Ontario,It was determined that he had sustained a compression fracture to the L2 vertebrae a small bony fragment off the C6 vertebrae a left occipital hematoma and a small laceration to his right kidney,"As such, I find that the evidence of the SO’s driving does not come close to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and, as indicated earlier, there is no evidence to support a causal connection between the actions of the SO and the motor vehicle collision caused by the Complainant. In fact, in reviewing the evidence in its entirety, it is clear that not only did the SO respond to the situation in full compliance with the Criminal Code and the Ontario Police Services Act, but he behaved at all times professionally, prudently and with good common sense and, as such, I find that there is absolutely no basis here for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tvi-300

2016,Ontario Provincial Police,,Ontario,X-rays revealed that the Complainant had a comminuted fracture of the left clavicle,"I further find that on the evidence on this record, it is far more likely that the Complainant either injured his clavicle when he fell, or he dislocated his shoulder when he fell and later broke his clavicle when he smashed his shoulder into the wall of the cell in an attempt to put his shoulder back into alignment. Whatever the mechanism of his injury, however, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that there was an excessive use of force by the police officers who arrested the Complainant, that the force used by police officers caused the injury to the Complainant or that there was any criminal wrongdoing by either the SO, WO #1 or WO #2.

2016,,Kitchener,Ontario,All of the injuries observed by his family doctor were consistent with the complainant having been grounded and then variously punched and kneed about his head and back area in an effort by the SOs to control and ultimately handcuff him,"Nonetheless, given the complainant’s size, aggression and determination not to do as lawfully required by the officers, I conclude that the conduct of the three SOs did not fall outside the range of what was reasonably necessary to attempt to subdue the complainant and take him into custody. The jurisprudence is clear - officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)) nor should they be judged to a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206).

While I find that the degree of force with which the Complainant’s head struck the ground may have been greater than perceived by the police officers as the momentum increased with the police officers falling with him, and may therefore have caused his injury, the jurisprudence is clear, police officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v.

In this case, there is an absence of any evidence from other drivers as to the SO’s driving prior to the collision; the pre-crash data only shows that she was driving at a rate of speed in excess of that being observed by other traffic ahead of her and that she failed to adjust her speed to take into account the other users of the roadway. As such, there are clearly ample grounds to believe that the SO was driving her motor vehicle in a careless manner without reasonable care and attention, contrary to s.130 of the Highway Traffic Act, but that the evidence is insufficient to rise to the level required pursuant to the Criminal Code. On that basis, there are no grounds for the laying of criminal charges.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-pvi-256
2016,,Hamilton,Ontario,He was taken from the scene to hospital and diagnosed with multiple fractures of his left forearm,"There remains the issue around the mechanism of the complainant’s injuries. The evidence suggests that they occurred from the impact with the subject officer’s motorcycle after the complainant’s Suzuki lurched forward. However, particularly in light of the medical evidence, one cannot dismiss the complainant’s fall to the ground, either after the collision with the police motorcycle or the push from the officer, as causing or contributing to the fractures he suffered. In the final analysis, however, the uncertainty in this area of the evidence is of no consequence given my analysis of the officer’s conduct. That is, while I am satisfied that the complainant’s injuries resulted from his collision with the subject officer’s motorcycle or his fall from his motorcycle, or some combination of the two, there remains nothing in what the officer did or failed to do that would justify criminal proceedings against him.

In my opinion, the injuries suffered by the Complainant pale in comparison to the outcome that the Complainant had planned for his own demise. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds that the actions exercised by the PRP TRU officers fell well within the limits prescribed by the criminal law. Accordingly, there are no grounds for proceeding with any charges in this case. I would add that, in my opinion, the actions of all the PRP TRU officers - the SO, WO #2, WO #3, WO #4 WO #6 and WO #9, as well as WO #7 and WO #8 under the direction of WO #1 - were professional and commendable.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ofi-234

On reviewing the video, it is without dispute that the Complainant’s attack on the officer was sudden and without provocation. It is also clear from the reaction of WO #1, as observed on the CCTV footage, in jumping backward and almost reactively removing his firearm from its holster in response to the sudden and violent movement of the Complainant, that WO #1 also clearly feared for the life of his partner. Although WO #1 did not discharge his firearm, he had the benefit of being on the other side of the police cruiser from the Complainant; an advantage that the SO did not have.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tfi-205

2016,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,He was then placed in the care of paramedics and transported to hospital for a mental health assessment,"It is not in issue that the complainant resisted the officers’ efforts to handcuff him. There is a suggestion in the evidence that the officers physically assaulted the complainant on various parts of his body, resulting in visible injuries. However, the injuries recorded in his medical records and the witness statements did not coincide with this account. Additionally, SIU investigators’ visual examination of his back and right shoulder area two days following the incident revealed no bruising. It is also alleged that the complainant was struck by a CEW multiple times. Yet, the CEW download records for the only two CEWs present during the incident had no record of deployments during that time period. The two officers carrying these devices, SO #1 and WO #1, confirmed their CEWs were temporarily un-holstered but never engaged, despite the complainant’s ongoing and extensive opposition. In the final analysis, even assuming for the moment that one of the officers manipulated the complainant’s wrist in an effort to wrest control of his arm, thereby causing the injury, the balance of the evidence indicates that the force applied by the involved officers in their involvement with the complainant was restrained, proportional and directly in response to the complainant’s continued resistance.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-287
2016,,,Ontario,He was pronounced dead at the scene,"On the evidence, it is clear that nothing that the SO said or did provoked the Complainant to jump to his death, on the contrary, it appears from all of the evidence that the Complainant was intent on ending his life and no amount of police intervention was going to change his mind. Despite the best efforts of the SO to dissuade the Complainant from taking the fatal step which he did, it appears that the Complainant was intent on his course of action which is confirmed when, in response to the SO’s question asking what he could do for the Complainant, the Complainant responded that the SO could watch him jump. It is clear on the evidence of all of the civilian witnesses that the Complainant was alone on the balcony when he jumped and that he alone was responsible for taking his life. Within two minutes of the SO’s arrival in the Complainant’s unit, before he had the opportunity to do anything more than engage the Complainant in brief conversation in an attempt to dissuade the Complainant from his course of action, the Complainant decided he needed to immediately jump to his death before anyone could prevent him doing so. On this basis, despite the tragic outcome for the Complainant, I am satisfied on reasonable grounds that there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ocd-245
2016,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario,X-rays taken later that day revealed that the Complainant suffered a subcapital fracture to his right femur,In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used.

2016,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,X-rays revealed that the Complainant had a pneumothorax collapsed lung and suspected rib fractures for the eighth ninth and tenth ribs on his left side,"Accordingly, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he may have suffered. The jurisprudence makes clear that while police officers’ actions must be commensurate with the task at hand, they cannot be expected to measure their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)) or to be judged against a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206).

2016,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Head,Ontario, Subsequent X-rays indicated that the Complainant had fractures to the vertebrae in his lower back,"Taking into consideration the fact that the Complainant had already been involved in a serious altercation at Roxxanne’s Bar and Grill, and that he had used his considerable strength to bulldoze through the two police officers trying to arrest him, it was not a stretch to find that he was more than capable of continuing to commit his assaultive behaviour, if he was not subdued. It is my opinion that if the injury to the Complainant was not pre-existing, it is more than likely that the Complainant suffered his injury when he was being severely stomped on at Roxxanne’s Bar and Grill. It would be difficult to comprehend how the minimal force used to subdue the Complainant at the hospital by SO #1 and SO #2 could have caused his back injuries when the extreme force inflicted on the Complainant at the bar, could not. Even if the injuries were caused as a result of the police officers attempts to subdue the Complainant, I cannot find that to be an excessive use of force. It is abundantly clear that the force used by both SO #1 and SO #2 was no more than required to meet and overcome the resistance and powerful physical strength of the Complainant. Without any doubt, the actions of both SO #1 and SO #2 fell well within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to affect his lawful detention.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-194

The complainant fractured his foot when he intentionally went out a window in his third floor apartment and fell to the ground. By all accounts, the police officers were not in his apartment and had no influence on his decision to go out the window, other than merely being present in front of his apartment building at the time.

2016,,,Ontario,The Complainant was diagnosed with a displaced oblique fracture of her right wrist,"Reviewing the evidentiary record, the SO was driving fully within her own lane of traffic at speeds that accorded with the general flow of traffic on the Highway 400 ramp. The SO made no abrupt or unsafe maneuvers prior to her vehicle being struck by the Complainant. The SO was alert and safely in complete control of her police cruiser at all times. In fact, it is my conclusion that the cumulative evidence indicates that the Complainant directly caused the accident as a result of her attempt to maneuver across three lanes of traffic in order to access the Highway 400 ramp without sufficient time or preparation. It is my opinion that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that the SO drove dangerously and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-pvi-198

According to WO #2 and the civilian witnesses present for the arrest, the only force employed by the SO was to handcuff the Complainant with her arms behind her back. There was no evidence that this was done in a manner that was unreasonable or that an excessive degree of force was used. Although an x-ray revealed the Complainant may have a broken bone in her left wrist, there was no evidence that any physical contact she had with the SO was the cause of this injury.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-pci-208
2016,Toronto Police Service,Midland,Ontario, The Complainant was pronounced dead at the scene,"The offences that arise for consideration in this matter are dangerous driving causing death and criminal negligence causing death contrary to sections 249 and 220 of the Criminal Code respectively. Both offences are predicated on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from a reasonable level of care in the circumstances. I find that there is no evidence that the SO’s driving created a danger to other users of the roadway. At no time did he interfere with any other traffic, the environmental conditions were good and he used his emergency equipment prudently, activating his roof lights but not his siren as he was concerned that might aggravate the BMW’s driver’s already dangerous driving; he also maintained a substantial distance at all points while following the BMW, as is evidenced by the ICC. The officer did nothing to exacerbate the BMW’s pattern of dangerous driving. It was the recklessness of the driver of the BMW that brought about the tragic death of the Complainant.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tvd-258
2016,Niagara Regional Police Service,St. Catharines,Ontario,X-rays confirmed that he had sustained a fracture of his tenth left rib,"The SO recalled delivering a light distractionary blow to the Complainant’s facial area and one or two punches to his left side. The video footage clearly showed the Complainant repeatedly resisting the SO’s many efforts to gain control of his hands. Throughout the struggle, the SO was seen delivering one punch to his face, three to his left back and a knee to his groin. None of these strikes appeared to impact with much force based on the Complainant’s lack of reaction to them on the video footage. The SO also held his CEW pointed into the Complainant’s chest briefly, about ten seconds, before re-holstering it. And yet all of these efforts were futile, as none resulted in the Complainant acquiescing and allowing the SO access to his hands to handcuff him. In fact, the video footage depicted the SO showing restraint and professionalism, taking time to speak with the Complainant and even taking care to put his eye glasses out of harm’s way. Despite the Complainant’s unrelenting defiance and the SO’s acute shoulder injury, the SO did not continue to raise the level of force deployed, even though the circumstances may have justified it. Rather, he made a restrained and measured decision to wait for assistance.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-237
2016,Hamilton Police Service,,Ontario,X-rays revealed that the Complainant suffered a fractured left rib,"Police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection. It must be remembered that the police engage in dangerous and demanding work and often have to react quickly to emergencies. Their actions should be judged in light of these exigent circumstances. As Anderson J.A. explained in R. v. Bottrell (1981), 60 C.C.C. (2d) 211 (B.C.C.A.):In determining whether the amount of force used by the officer was necessary the jury must have regard to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used.

,,Brampton,Ontario, As a result of the collision Complainant\xa0#2 sustained multiple facial fractures that required surgical repair while Complainant\xa0#1 suffered a mild traumatic brain injury a non-displaced fracture to his left clavicle and multiple lacerations to the left side of his face,"On a review of all of the evidence, it is clear that the SO was travelling at a rate of speed approximately 30 km/h in excess of the speed limit in the area when he collided with Complainant #1’s motor vehicle. However, the collision occurred at 5:43 a.m. on a Sunday morning, road conditions were dry, the weather was clear, it was light out, and traffic was minimal, if any. Further, the SO was neither texting nor receiving any texts at the time immediately prior to or at the time of the collision and there is no evidence that he was not driving within the normal standards of care of a prudent driver, with the exception of his excessive rate of speed. The fact that Complainant #1 chose to engage in the maneuver which he did appears to support the conclusion that he and the SO both likely did not expect any traffic to be in the area at that time on a Sunday morning. I find on this evidence that the driving of the SO does not rise to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm” and as such find that there is insufficient evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed.

This offence is predicated on conduct that amounts to a marked departure from the level of care that a reasonable person would have exercised in the circumstances. There is no question that the SO was proceeding lawfully through a green light at a controlled intersection when he struck the Complainant, who had disobeyed a red light and driven into his path. Yet, the SO was not without fault. Firstly, he was exceeding the speed limit as he approached the intersection, which reduced to about 10 km/h over as he entered the intersection. Secondly, he was distracted by the Giant Tiger parking lot to his left and was not directing his attention in his direction of travel. The ICC video confirmed that the SO remained in his lane and made no evasive move to avoid the cyclist, which is supportive of his assertion that he did not see the cyclist until the last moment. His speed at the time of impact was between 54 km/h and 64 km/h.footnote 8[8] It was dark outside and the intersection was partially illuminated with artificial lighting.

Although, for whatever reason, the SO failed to make her left turn in safety and thus struck the Complainant, presumably due to a momentary lack of attention towards other users of the roadway, I cannot find that there is any evidence, other than the collision, that the driving by the SO rose to the level of driving required to constitute “a marked departure from the norm”. An accident alone is not sufficient for a finding of dangerous driving.

As such, I find that there is insufficient evidence to form reasonable grounds to believe that a criminal offence has been committed and thus no charges will issue in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tvi-147
2017,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario, The post-mortem examination determined the cause of death to be multiple blunt force trauma,"It is, of course, pure speculation to attempt to determine what was in the mind of the Complainant when he chose to jump, or fell, out of a 15th story window. Although there is evidence that the Complainant was wanted in connection with a breach of his probation order, it is beyond the scope of this investigation, nor is it necessary, to determine why, or even how, the Complainant jumped or fell from the 15th floor or even if he had intended to cause his own death by doing so.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-tcd-110

2016,Halton Regional Police Service,,Ontario, The Complainant was transported by ambulance to the hospital where an x-ray revealed that the Complainant had a transverse fracture through the midshaft of the proximal phalanx of the first toe a fracture of the right 2nd metatarsal neck 2nd toe and a questionable undisplaced fracture through the right 3rd metatarsal neck 3rd toe,"In all the circumstances however, the totality of the evidence makes it clear that the injury suffered by this youth resulted from his inexperience and inattention, and were not related to any actions taken by the SO. Accordingly, no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ovi-178
2016,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,At the time the Complainant was suffering from an undiagnosed mental disorder and was posing an increasing threat to himself and others,"It is not in dispute that the Complainant was holding the metal barbell at the time the SO entered his bedroom. The Complainant’s version of events differs from the officers regarding when he dropped the barbell and the SO’s distance from him when the CEW was deployed. I have significant concerns about the reliability of the Complainant’s recollections of the events, however, given his highly agitated state and his observed incoherence both before and after the incident.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-175
2016,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario, Paramedics attended the scene and the Complainant was transported to the hospital where it was determined that he had multiple mandibular lower jawbone fractures,"Before concluding, however, I believe that it is worthy of note that the SO considered all options in dealing with the Complainant and rejected the use of his baton, due to the speed with which things were moving, and, more importantly, rejected a lethal use of force. Despite the repeated and panicked screams by WO #9 for the SO to “Get your gun”, the SO resisted that impulse in consideration of the deadly outcome if he resorted to his firearm in a case where all three parties were in such close proximity. Although from a distance it may have appeared to civilian bystanders that the SO was using excessive force when he repeatedly punched the Complainant in the face, it is clear and I find that he only struck the Complainant up until the point in time when he lost consciousness and relinquished his hold on the firearm and that he did not continue after the danger had passed, as confirmed by several of the civilian witnesses. All in all, I find that unlike the unfortunate outcomes of many police interactions with persons suffering from mental health issues, the SO considered all of his options, kept a level head and thereby possibly prevented a loss of life. It is unfortunate that the Complainant suffered the serious injury that he did, but on the whole, the outcome could have been far worse if not for the quick thinking and actions of the SO.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-165
2016,St. Thomas Police Service,Strong,Ontario, At the hospital the Complainant was diagnosed with a fractured right shoulder,"With respect to the amount of force used by the SO in his attempts to subdue the Complainant, I find that his actions were justified in the circumstances and that he used no more force than necessary to subdue the Complainant who was clearly resisting being handcuffed. I also find that the injuries to the Complainant’s shoulder and hand were more than likely caused prior to his ever coming into contact with the SO; however, even if it were caused by the efforts of the SO to subdue the Complainant, which I find to be extremely unlikely, I cannot find that to have been an excessive use of force. On this record, it is clear that the force used by the SO progressed in a measured and proportionate fashion to meet and overcome the Complainant’s resistance, and fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to effect his lawful detention. The jurisprudence is clear, officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)) nor should they be judged to a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206).",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-151

2016,York Regional Police,Head,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital where she was diagnosed with a non-displaced intra articular fracture involving the proximal radial head fracture to a bone of the right elbow,"Thus, I find on the record before me that the statement from the Complainant falls far short of the standard of reasonable grounds to believe that an offence of assault or assault causing bodily harm has been committed.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-122
2016,,Sault Ste.

Thus, timely, potentially corroborating evidence has been lost in this case. This is not only unfortunate, but could in some circumstances affect the SIU’s ability to confirm or probe the accuracy of the WO’s statement, particularly where notification of a possible injury has been delayed. I will forward a letter to SSMPS Chief of Police to address setting up a more stringent protocol to prevent a similar situation in the future.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-047

WO #3 could not detect the Complainant’s pulse; however, WO #3 continued to perform CPR until Toronto Fire Department personnel and paramedics arrived on scene at 6:14 a.m. A back-up paramedic unit was requested and a cardiac monitor was attached, which revealed that the Complainant still had a heart rhythm. Defibrillation pads were attached to the Complainant. The Complainant was placed in the ambulance at 6:17 a.m. The SO was in the ambulance with two firefighters, two paramedics, and a paramedic supervisor. The ambulance arrived at the hospital at 6:42 a.m., and at 6:45 a.m., the Complainant was pronounced dead.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tcd-036

The WO and SO engaged in a struggle with the Complainant to such an extent that the WO attempted to control the Complainant in a headlock and the SO cautioned she would use her conducted energy weapon (CEW) if he did not cooperate. The jurisprudence has clearly stated that the standard to which officers are to be held is not perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak, [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206) nor are they expected to measure the degree of their responding force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975), 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)). Although the evidence suggests that it was likely the manner in which the SO manipulated the Complainant’s left arm that resulted in it dislocating, I do not have reasonable grounds to form a belief that the SO pulled his left arm behind his back in a manner outside of her training or with more force than was reasonably necessary to complete his handcuffing given the circumstances.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-pci-204
2016,Toronto Police Service,Toronto,Ontario, The Complainant was arrested and transported to hospital where he was diagnosed with several facial fractures,"On a review of all of the evidence, only the physical evidence is able to support this secondary version of events.

2016,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Cambridge,Ontario,Upon his release the Complainant was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with a left distal radius forearm fracture,"In my view, there is no evidentiary basis for a finding of excessive force by the SO or any of the other involved officers. Section 25(1) of the Criminal Code limits the force an officer may use to that which is reasonably necessary in the circumstances in the execution of their lawful duties. According to WO #1, WO #2 and WO #4, the Complainant was not grounded or struck by any officer, nor was his left arm manipulated in any manner other than to apply handcuffs. He was never taken down to the ground during the arrest process. Unfortunately, there were no civilian witnesses or video recordings of the Complainant’s arrest, and he had no memory of the event. The CCTV recordings from the pub depicted a violent physical confrontation between the Complainant and CW #1, in which the Complainant fell backwards at one point after being kicked and braced his landing with his outstretched arms. This is most likely when his injury occurred. Based on the available evidence, it is clear that the force applied by the involved officers in their encounter with the Complainant cannot be attributed to his wrist injury, and was so minimal that it raises no concerns of excessive force.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-134
2016,London Police Service,London,Ontario,At the hospital it was determined he did not have any rib injury but was found to have a fracture of the left eye socket,"The jurisprudence makes clear, while their conduct in question must be commensurate with the task at hand, police officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.) or to be judged against a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206).

2016,Sarnia Police Service,Sarnia,Ontario,WO\xa0#3 called for an ambulance and the Complainant was transported by ambulance to the hospital where he was assessed and later transferred to a London hospital for surgery,"According to the prisoner log, the Complainant’s cell was checked on nine occasions between the time he was lodged, at approximately 8:40 p.m., and when WO #3 opened the cell door to release him at 7:10 a.m. During that time frame the Complainant was apparently sleeping from 12:45 a.m. until the time that WO #3 attempted to wake him at 7:10 a.m. While the policy mandated officers to check on intoxicated persons every 30 minutes, and the log indicates that checks were made closer to one hour and on several occasions up to one and one half hours apart, I infer from the fact that WO #4 was called in to work an overtime shift to assist WO #2, that the police service was understaffed at the relevant time and it was likely a busy night. As such, although the actual visual checks at the cell door may have been less than ideal, I cannot find the delay of 30 - 60 minutes between the recommended cell checks as indicating “a wanton or reckless disregard for the lives and safety of others”. Additionally, as the video from outside the cell was unavailable for viewing and there is evidence that, despite the lack of actual physical cell checks, that WO #2 was able to monitor the prisoners from a video monitor, I am unable to determine definitively how many times the Complainant was actually observed either in person through the cell window or by anyone watching from the live video monitor.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-059
2016,,,Ontario,X-rays were taken and revealed the Complainant had a fracture in her right forearm,"While it is regrettable that the Complainant’s arm was broken during her interaction with SO #1 and SO #2 and the other officers, on a review of the totality of the evidence, I cannot conclude that the officers used more force than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances. Accordingly, there are no reasonable grounds to believe that SO #1 and SO #2 exceeded the ambit of justifiable force in the circumstances. Consequently, no charges will be laid against either subject officer in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-110
2016,,Sarnia,Ontario, The Complainant was transported to the hospital where he was diagnosed with an open fracture of his left elbow and a bruise on the left side of his scalp,"I appreciate that the Complainant suffers from serious mental health issues; however, there was no possibility of reasoning with him, or talking him through his mental state. The police were faced with a violent, dynamic and unpredictable situation, and they took all reasonable steps to disarm and control the Complainant. In the circumstances, I conclude that the SO’s baton strike which unfortunately broke the Complainant’s elbow did not fall outside the range of what was reasonable necessary to attempt to disarm and subdue the Complainant and take him into custody. The jurisprudence makes clear, while their conduct in question must be commensurate with the task at hand, police officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.) or to be judged against a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206).

It is clear that they went into the home without personal protective gear and risked their safety despite the hazards in an attempt to save the Complainant’s life.

2016,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,The attending doctor could not exclude “a mildly displaced nasal bone fracture,"With respect to the amount of force used by the SO in his attempt to apprehend the Complainant, I find that his action in grabbing onto the Complainant was more than justified in the circumstances and that he used no more force than necessary to apprehend the Complainant, who was clearly intent on fleeing with the stolen property. I find that the degree of force with which the Complainant’s head struck the ground may have been greater than intended by the SO, as the momentum of the SO’s running, combined with the sudden stop by the Complainant, caused the Complainant and the SO to collide and both fell to the pavement, resulting in the Complainant injuring his face. While it is less than certain that the Complainant’s nose was broken in the fall, even if it were caused by the efforts of the SO to apprehend a fleeing individual, I cannot find that to have been an excessive use of force. The relevant case law with respect to use of force is very clear, officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont.

2016,London Police Service,,Ontario,Although there were no visible injuries until after the Complainant was taken to the station and placed in the cells a visit back to the hospital the next day confirmed the diagnosis of a fractured right orbital bone,"With respect to the amount of force used by the SO in his attempt to subdue the Complainant, I find that the actions of the SO, as clearly shown in the security video, were justified in the circumstances and that he used no more force than necessary to subdue the Complainant who was actively resisting the SO in his attempts to handcuff and remove the Complainant from the hospital. It is clear from the video that the SO was having difficulty gaining control of the Complainant and that his actions were in response to a fast moving situation where he was alone with the Complainant and responding to the Complainant’s active physical resistance to his arrest. The courts have been very clear with respect to the amount of force which is permissible when an officer is carrying out his lawful duties and that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.) nor should they be judged to a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206). Although I am unable to definitely determine the source of the Complainant’s injury, if it was caused by the actions of the SO in attempting to take control and effect the arrest of the Complainant, I cannot find that to have been an excessive use of force. On this record, it is clear that the force used by the SO progressed in a measured and proportionate fashion to meet and overcome the Complainant’s resistance and surprising strength, and fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to effect his lawful detention.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-128

The SO was lawfully engaged in his duty when he signaled for the vehicle to stop. The CW, due to his own desire to evade responsibility, chose to speed off and was solely responsible for the subsequent crash.

C.A.) or to be judged against a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206). SO #2 was entitled to use reasonable force to get the Complainant to comply with the demand to give up his hands for handcuffing during the course of a legal (however imprudent) arrest. One strike to the ribs in this context when the arrested party resists being handcuffed would not be unreasonable and would not constitute excessive force.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-164
2016,Ottawa Police Service,Ottawa,Ontario,On May 24 2016 however the radiologist who viewed the Complainant’s x-rays did a re-assessment of his x-rays and concluded that it was unlikely that the Complainant had a fractured rib,"Pursuant to section 25(1) of the Criminal Code, police officers are restricted in their use of force to that which is reasonably necessary in the execution of a lawful duty. Turning first to the lawfulness of the Complainant’s apprehension, it is clear from the statement of several civilian witnesses that the Complainant was being loud, swearing, screaming and causing a disturbance in a public place (contrary to 175(1) of the Criminal Code) outside of the residence. Additionally, he was tying up the 911 dispatcher, as well as numerous police personnel, by continually contacting 911 when he had clearly been told on numerous occasions by numerous police officers that his matter was one that he would have to deal with in civil court and that he was to cease and desist calling 911 and tying up valuable police resources. On that basis, the officers also had reasonable grounds to arrest the Complainant for committing the offence of public mischief contrary to s. 140 of the Criminal Code. As such, the arrest and apprehension of the Complainant was legally justified in the circumstances.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-120
2016,,,Ontario,The Complainant’s medical condition deteriorated quickly and she was diagnosed with a large intraventicular bleed brain hemorrhage,"On an overview of all of the evidence, it is clear that the Complainant suffered a brain hemorrhage earlier in the evening of May 9th, 2016, after which she drove a friend home and then became confused. Due to her erratic driving, she first came to the attention of the CW, who then contacted the SO. WO #2 also attended to assist. On all of the evidence before me, it appears that the Complainant had already experienced a brain hemorrhage prior to any involvement with police and that the police, in dealing with her, showed nothing but kindness and patience and did everything they could to assist the Complainant. There was no outward indication that the Complainant required medical attention until she vomited, at which point an ambulance was immediately called and she was transported to hospital. According to the coroner who reviewed the matter, nothing police or anyone else did could have affected the outcome of this matter and the Complainant eventually succumbed to the brain hemorrhage and passed away days later.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ood-118
2016,Peterborough Police Service,Peterborough,Ontario,Lai was transported to hospital where it was confirmed that he had sustained a fractured rib as well as a single bullet injury to the abdomen destroying his gallbladder and shattering his right kidney both of which then had to be removed,"Subject to subsections (4) and (5), a person is not justified for the purposes of subsection (1) in using force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm unless the person believes on reasonable grounds that it is necessary for the self-preservation of the person or the preservation of any one under that person’s protection from death or grievous bodily harm.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ofi-079
2016,,,Ontario,The Complainant alleges that the fracture occurred as a result of his arrest by the SO,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered, even were I to find that the officers caused the injury, which I am not inclined to do. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-071
2016,,Peterborough,Ontario,The complainant was taken to hospital and found to have an acute minimally displaced left anterior third rib fracture,"I find that there is no evidence that the SO’s driving created a danger to other users of the roadway. At no time did he interfere with any other traffic, of which there was very little at that time of day, and the weather was clear and the road conditions were good, as revealed in the photos taken following the collision. While it may well be that the complainant might not have attempted to take the off-ramp at the speeds with which he did and lost control of his vehicle, were he not attempting to evade police, I find that his injuries were of his own making in that he was already driving at dangerous speeds before he even noticed the SO and, in his attempt to flee, he continued on in the same vein.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ovi-219
2016,Ontario Provincial Police,,Ontario,In the early morning hours of May 13 2016 the CW woke up to find the Complainant in the detached garage of their residence with the windows covered Once she realized that he also had a firearm she left the residence with her children and called 911 advising that the Complainant had locked himself in the garage with a rifle A short time later the Complainant sent the CW a message through a mutual friend that the children were not to go into the garage although she could OPP officers responded and began an operation that involved the East Region Emergency Response Team ERT and the Provincial TRU being mobilized SO\xa0#1 and SO\xa0#2 took command of the incident Repeated attempts were made to contact the Complainant inside the garage both on scene and by telephone and text but to no avail Eventually the door to the garage was breached and the Complainant was found hanging inside He was already deceased A five page note addressed to the CW and the children was also located inside the garage,"It may well be that WO #2, who responded by driving towards the residence immediately upon becoming aware of the 911 call from the CW, could have prevented the suicide of the Complainant if he had immediately attended the Complainant’s home, which had been his initial plan until he was directed to attend on the CW. On the other hand, WO #2 could have himself been killed or been involved in killing the Complainant. With the information provided by the CW, that the Complainant was in possession of a firearm, it would have been foolhardy to rush in without taking the proper precautions. It is not unusual, unfortunately, for suicidal persons to resort to what has been euphemistically referred to as “suicide by cop” and it was incumbent on the officers tasked with overseeing this critical incident to ensure not only the safety of the public, including the Complainant, if possible, but to also ensure that the officers under their command take every precaution to ensure their own safety.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-pcd-121
2016,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,The Complainant was taken to hospital where he was diagnosed with a comminuted slightly impacted fracture of the nasal bones nasal bone fracture,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he may have suffered.

2016,Ontario Provincial Police,Bancroft,Ontario,The cause of death was confirmed as a gunshot wound to the head,"The SO was a trained crisis negotiator. He had one opportunity to speak with the Complainant on the phone about 20 minutes prior to the sound of the gunshot. Regrettably, the SO’s efforts to convince the Complainant to turn himself over to the officers positioned outside his residence were unsuccessful. The SO has a common law duty as a police officer to protect and preserve life. His apparent verbal attempts to resolve the incident by trying to convince the Complainant to present himself peacefully to the police was professional, well-intentioned and consistent with that duty.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-pcd-105
2016,,,Ontario,The Complainant was transported to hospital and it was determined that he suffered a right orbital fracture and a sprained ankle,"In light of the close confines, the danger to the officers from a man who had been described as armed with both a firearm and a large knife, and the speed with which things were moving, as well as the man appearing to be under the influence of some type of illegal substance which made his reactions both odd and unpredictable, it was crucial that the Complainant be apprehended as expeditiously as possible. Unfortunately, officers do not always have the luxury of proceeding slowly and cautiously in these precarious situations.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-102
2016,Greater Sudbury Police Service,,Ontario,Once at hospital the Complainant was diagnosed with cocaine psychosis a fractured rib and pneumothorax a collapsed lung,"With respect to the amount of force used by the SO in attempting to take custody of the Complainant and to thwart him in his intention of taking his own life, I find that his actions were justified in the circumstances and that he used no more force than necessary to apprehend the Complainant, who was clearly out of control and not thinking clearly due to the consumption of illegal narcotics. In light of the fact that he had already made statements to the SO that it was his intention to end his life by jumping into traffic, that he then began to act on that statement despite the efforts of the SO to reason with him, and that he was ignoring the SO’s commands to stop, it was incumbent on the SO to do everything in his power to prevent the Complainant from acting on his threat. Further, in light of the Complainant’s violent opposition to being taken to hospital and his combative and aggressive behaviour towards both the paramedics and the SO, I find that if his injury occurred when he fell to the ground with the SO, and he landed on top of him, the SO was using only as much force as was necessary in the circumstances and he was duty bound to do so to prevent the Complainant harming himself or taking his own life. On this record, it is clear that the force used by the SO progressed in a measured and proportionate fashion to meet and overcome the Complainant’s resistance and his desire to end his own life, and fell within the range of what was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to effect his lawful detention.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-098
2016,Halton Regional Police Service,Oakville,Ontario,The Complainant also suffered an acute kidney injury,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the Complainant’s arrest and detention, and the manner in which they were carried out, were lawful notwithstanding whether the injury which he suffered, may have been as a consequence of the CEW deployment (which is not certain). I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officer fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case, and no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-092
2016,Toronto Police Service,,Ontario,The complainant was diagnosed with a fractured nasal bone,"When the officers arrived at the apartment, the complainant was in her bedroom and CW #1 was in the living room. SO #2 went to the bedroom to speak to the complainant. The complainant was either asleep or unconscious at the time. When the complainant awoke, she was aggressive with SO #2 and refused to cooperate. She was extremely intoxicated. SO #1 entered the room, and both officers attempted to take hold of the complainant, one on each arm. The complainant hit SO #2 and pulled her own arm back, preventing SO #2 from taking hold of her. The officers struggled to take control of the complainant, who continued to actively resist. SO #2 stated that the complainant then fell to the floor in the course of the struggle on the bed. SO #1 stated that they pulled the complainant off the bed and she immediately went to her knees, stretched out on the floor face down and continued to thrash and struggle. Given the broken nose the complainant sustained, the small and contained blood stain on the carpet, the struggle occurring on the bed, and the complainant’s extreme intoxication, I believe SO #2’s recollection to be more accurate.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-180
2016,Ontario Provincial Police,Sioux Lookout,Ontario,At the hospital the Complainant alleged that her injury had been caused by the SO in the course of her arrest,"Despite these concerns, I am mandated to determine whether police, in their interaction with the Complainant, used excessive force and thereby caused her injury. On a review of all of the evidence before me, and paying particular attention to the evidence of CW #3 and CW #5 who confirm the evidence of WO #2footnote 1[1], I am unable to find that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the injury to the Complainant was caused by her interaction with police. The evidence is clear in that neither police officer ever entered the motel room as alleged nor was there any physical force used by either officer towards either the Complainant or CW #2, as both were cooperative with police and were handcuffed and lodged in the cruiser without incident.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-pci-097
2016,,Niagara,Ontario,Following his arrest the complainant was transported to hospital and diagnosed with a broken nose,"On all of the evidence before me, I cannot find that the officers resorted to an excessive use of force in overcoming the resistance of a possibly armed and known to be violent male who first fled and then was actively resisting officers’ attempts to gain control of his hands and affect his lawful detention.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-227
2016,Barrie Police Service,,Ontario,On August 1 2016 at approximately 9:00 p.m the CW made a 911 call complaining about the conduct of her roommate the complainant As a result the SO WO 3 and WO 4 were dispatched and subsequently arrested the complainant pursuant to the Liquor Licence Act for being intoxicated in a public place contrary to section 31(4 The complainant was transported to the station and was belligerent with the booking sergeant – WO 1 – as the sergeant attempted to ask him some questions The complainant was then escorted to the cell area by the PE and the SO Just after being placed in cell\xa0#3 the complainant physically resisted the officers’ efforts to close the cell door He grabbed the door and was trying to pull it open while the SO was trying to pull it closed The PE grabbed the cell door and tried to close it several times but the complainant placed his fingers on the edge of the door preventing it from closing The PE told the complainant several times to move his hand and the SO used his right arm to reach into the cell to push the complainant away from the door The PE and the SO were eventually able to close the cell door at which point they left the cell area When the SO left the cell area and returned to the hallway he noted that there was blood on his right arm and WO\xa0#1 told him that the complainant had been injured The SO then returned to the cell area and observed that the complainant’s left ring and middle fingers were covered in blood The SO tried to get the complainant out of the cell to take him to hospital but the complainant refused The complainant finally came out of the cell his hands were placed in bags and WO\xa0#1 gave the SO a bag with a piece of the complainant’s finger in it which he brought to hospital with him At the hospital the complainant underwent a procedure to close the wounds of his injured fingers,"On this evidence, and as clearly seen on the cell video, it appears that the complainant was actively resisting the best efforts of the officers to ensure that he was safely lodged in a cell until sober. Despite the actions of the officers, the complainant somehow managed to place his left hand in harm’s way after the officers had successfully removed his right hand and closed the door.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-200

I am, therefore, not only satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and that there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case, but also that the actions of all officers ultimately saved the complainant’s life.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-pfi-220
,,Head,Ontario,The complainant was transported to the hospital by ambulance where she was assessed as having sustained a radial head fracture of the right humerus bone a severed nerve of the right arm and a concussion,"On a review of the evidence, it is clear that the SO was at all times driving at a rate of speed below the speed limit, presumably to take into account the poor road and weather conditions, and there is no evidence whatsoever that could lead to the conclusion that his driving could amount to a marked departure from the standard of care exercised by a reasonable person. In all of the circumstances in this matter, including the fact that the SO was driving at speeds below the speed limit, was taking into account the road and weather conditions, was apparently aware of and perhaps distracted momentarily by other users of the roadway, including the female and male passenger running across Richmond Street and causing another motor vehicle to have to brake hard to avoid a collision, and the fact that his motor vehicle made contact with a pedestrian, I cannot find fault with the SO or his driving. It is clear that the claimant stepped out into traffic in poor weather and lighting conditions where there was no crosswalk and no traffic controls.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ovi-089
2016,Niagara Regional Police Service,Welland,Ontario,On Saturday March 26 2016 around 10:30 p.m NRPS were called to an apartment building in Welland for a man who was out of control and smashing things Police were advised that the man had fallen down some stairs and had been knocked out by another resident in the building The SO and WO 2 arrived on scene at approximately 10:40\xa0p.m As the officers entered the building WO 2 noticed a broken window to the side of the front door One of the persons at the front door advised that the complainant had broken the window and that he was in an apartment on the second floor That person also indicated that the complainant had a health issue of concern to the police The SO and WO 2 went up one flight of stairs and was met by CW 1 and CW 2 at the door to their apartment As they entered the apartment CW 2 told WO 2 that the complainant had been out of control in the hallway and had smashed something When CW 2 had looked out to see what was going on the complainant came at CW 2 and tried to force his way into the apartment CW 2 punched the complainant once in the face and knocked him out The SO and WO 2 entered the apartment The complainant was lying on the kitchen floor and appeared to be resting or unconscious The complainant’s head was near a fridge in the corner of the kitchen and he was bleeding from his facial area There was also a lot of blood on the floor The complainant was breathing heavily and sweating and had swelling to the left side of his face WO 1 arrived in the apartment and noticed an indentation in the wall near to where the complainant’s head was positioned as well as a fair amount of blood on the floor in the kitchen area and blood on the complainant’s lips nose area and arms WO 2 told the complainant that an ambulance would be coming to take care of him The complainant started to regain consciousness and it was apparent to WO 2 that the complainant was intoxicated The complainant stated Where is he and then added I am going to get him He was agitated upset and angry and he started to get up on one knee WO 2 told the complainant to calm down and stay down on the ground The complainant continued to try to stand up and behaved aggressively The SO was explaining to the complainant that he was under arrest for mischief and the ambulance was coming The SO told the complainant to listen or he would administer his CEW The complainant started to move towards the front door The SO shouted Taser Taser Taser At that point the SO deployed his CEW and both darts entered the left side of the complainant with the probes very close together The complainant went slowly down onto his knees and back onto his side He did not strike his head on the ground The complainant again tried to get up repeating Where’s the guy that hit me I want to fuck him up The SO placed his foot on the right arm or shoulder area of the complainant telling him to settle down and that an ambulance was on its way The complainant had his fists clenched as he tried to get up saying again that he wanted to go after the person who hit him The SO redeployed the CEW causing the complainant to remain lying on the ground Fire department personnel and paramedics arrived The complainant was taken to hospital where it was determined that he had suffered a brain bleed,"In my view, there is no evidentiary basis for a finding of excessive force by the SO. Pursuant to section 25(1) of the Criminal Code, officers are limited in their use of force to that which is reasonably necessary in the execution of their duties. The only force employed by the SO was the two deployments of his CEW. Faced with an intoxicated, angry and aggressive complainant, who had been involved in very recent violent altercations, was not following direction and continued to make threats, I am satisfied that the force used by the SO was reasonable to prevent further harm by the complainant. It is highly probable that the complainant received the brain bleed on the evening in question, most likely from either falling down the stairs or his physical confrontation with CW #2, but in any event, there was no evidence to suggest this injury was caused at the hands of the involved police officers.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-084

2016,Ontario Provincial Police,Grey,Ontario, The complainant attended a hospital the next day and was diagnosed with a fractured left sixth rib,"With respect to the amount of force used by officers in their attempts to arrest and handcuff the complainant, on a review of all of the evidence, I find that their actions were justified in the circumstances and that they used no more force than necessary to effect the arrest of the complainant. Based on the information officers had at the time, that they were apprehending two armed men who had allegedly pointed a firearm at a 16-year-old and were alleged to have been discharging their firearm, the actions of the officers in executing a high risk apprehension at gun point and securing both gentlemen as quickly as possible was completely justified.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-pci-086

2016,Niagara Regional Police Service,Welland,Ontario,The cause of death was determined to be drowning and hypothermia due to submersion in cold water,"The issue before me is whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that SO #1 and /or SO #2 committed criminal negligence cause death and/or failure to provide the necessities of life for their role in the complainant’s death. Both offences require at the very minimum conduct that amounts to a marked and substantial departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in all the circumstances. I do not believe that the evidence comes close to meeting this standard. In fact, in my opinion, there is no evidence that suggests that SO #1 or SO #2 were, in any way, responsible for the complainant’s death, by either act or omission. It is readily apparent that both officers did everything possible under the circumstances to determine whether the complainant, on March 31, 2016, was actively suicidal. There was nothing about his physical appearance or emotional presentation that would suggest that he was incapable of caring for himself. He appeared lucid and did not appear at all impaired by alcohol or drugs and was appropriately dressed for the temperature. Despite many opportunities, the complainant, to his detriment, was not forthcoming about the intensity of his suicidal intent with any of the police and emergency personnel at the scene. The officers checked with the hospital, who confirmed he had been there the day before but not for mental health issues. I have concluded that the complainant was the sole author of his demise. I am unable to find any fault with the investigation and conduct of either SO #1 or SO #2 that would give me reasonable grounds to believe they committed a criminal offence and as a result, no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-ocd-087

The jurisprudence is clear, officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont.

I find that no police officer had any hand in the complainant going out of the window or injuring his leg and that no officer used any force against the complainant whatsoever, other than to lift him up after he was injured and place him into a chair to await ambulance assistance.

I find that the degree of force with which the complainant’s face struck the ground may have been greater than perceived by the officers as the momentum increased with the officers falling with the complainant. The jurisprudence is clear, officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont.

2016,Toronto Police Service,Head,Ontario,The complainant was diagnosed with a fractured left ankle,"In these circumstances, I have to consider the provisions as set out under s. 25(1) of the Criminal Code. On the facts as outlined above, I find that the officers, in their attempts to disarm and arrest a non-compliant and armed complainant, acted on reasonable grounds, were justified in their actions and used no more force than was necessary for that purpose. In finding as such, I am aware that police actions should not be judged against a standard of perfection, that they cannot be expected to measure the force used with exactitude and that regard must be had to the circumstances as they existed at the time the force was used. [See R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.) and (R. v. Nasogaluk [2010] 1 S.C.R. 6.)

As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with criminal charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-tci-034
2017,Ontario Provincial Police,,Ontario,On June 24th 2017 at approximately 10:31 p.m the Complainant was arrested for being intoxicated in a public place contrary to the Liquor Licence Act After his arrest the Complainant was lodged in a cell at the OPP detachment The Complainant removed his shirt and put it around his neck in the cell OPP officers went into the cell to retrieve the shirt in order that the Complainant not harm himself but the Complainant refused to give them the shirt and resisted causing a struggle between himself and the police officers over the shirt,"I find that the actions of the SO were necessary and that he used no more force than was required to remove the shirt and ensure the Complainant’s safety. In coming to this conclusion, I have considered the law as set out by our highest courts that officers are not expected to measure the degree of their responsive force to a nicety (R. v. Baxter (1975) 27 C.C.C. (2d) 96 (Ont. C.A.)) nor should they be judged to a standard of perfection (R. v. Nasogaluak [2010] 1 S.C.R. 206.). As such, I am therefore satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and that there are no grounds to believe that any of the police officers committed a criminal offence during their interaction with the Complainant and that they were acting at all times in his best interests. Based on this finding, no charges will issue.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-17-pci-157

2016,Waterloo Regional Police Service,Hamilton,Ontario, Emergency Medical Services arrived at the scene and took the complainant to hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken nose,"In the final analysis, I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons that the man’s detention and the manner in which it was carried out were lawful notwithstanding the injury which he suffered, even were I to find that the officers caused the injury, which I am not inclined to do. I am, therefore, satisfied on reasonable grounds on this record that the actions exercised by the officers fell within the limits prescribed by the criminal law and there are no grounds for proceeding with charges in this case.",https://www.ontario.ca/page/siu-directors-report-case-16-oci-050
